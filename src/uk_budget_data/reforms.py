"""Reform definitions for UK Autumn Budget 2025.

This module contains all policy reforms announced in the November 2025 Budget,
implemented as Reform objects that can be processed by the data pipeline.

Reforms are organised into:
- Spending measures (costs to treasury)
- Tax measures (revenue raisers)
- Structural reforms (using simulation modifiers)

policyengine-uk v2.65.0+ includes the Autumn Budget parameter updates
(including two-child limit repeal from April 2026 and salary sacrifice pension
cap of £2,000 from April 2029) with proper fiscal year conversion that ensures
annual queries return April 30 values. We use a pre-Autumn Budget baseline to
show the impact of budget policies.
