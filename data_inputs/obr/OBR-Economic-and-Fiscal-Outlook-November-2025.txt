This Economic and fiscal outlook (EFO) sets out our central forecast and the uncertainties that
surround it for the five years to 2030-31, taking account of recent data and government policies
announced since our last forecast and up to and including the November 2025 Autumn Budget. The
forecasts presented in this document represent our collective view as the three independent members
of the OBR’s Budget Responsibility Committee (BRC). We take full responsibility for the judgements
that underpin them and for the conclusions we have reached.
As always, we have been greatly supported in our work by the staff of the OBR. We are very grateful
for their hard work and expertise. We have also drawn on the work and expertise of officials across
government in preparing these forecasts. We are grateful for their engagement and insight.
During the production of this forecast we learned that a respected former colleague, Pavandeep
Dhami, sadly passed away. Pav worked at the OBR in its first five years and played a huge part in
laying the OBR’s analytical foundations, which we have continued to build upon over the past
decade and benefit from today. He will be sadly missed by current and former OBR staff.
The date for this forecast was announced on 3 September, giving two weeks more than the ten
weeks’ notice required by the Memorandum of understanding between the Office for Budget
Responsibility, HM Treasury, the Department for Work and Pensions and HM Revenue and Customs
(MoU).
We published the timetable of the key stages of the forecast on 17 September, once it had been
agreed by signatories of the MoU. Given the unusual volume of speculation on the subject prior to
the publication of this EFO, the Chair has taken the unusual step of writing to the Chair of the
Commons Treasury Committee to set out the facts concerning the evolution of our forecast over the
course of the past four months. A copy of this letter is available on our website.
The timetable for the production of this forecast was as follows:
•

We undertook our regular summer review of the supply side of the economy, which
enables us to focus on the key drivers of potential output, a foundation stone of our
economy forecast, in slower time and outside of the full forecast round. It also allows us to
make judgements that feed into the first round of the forecast process for the Autumn
Budget and thereby inform policy development at the earliest opportunity. We informed
the Treasury of the outcome of the review on 7 August.

•

On the fiscal side, we initiated a process of reviewing fiscal forecast models and
judgements as part of a fiscal baseline review over the summer, prior to the main forecast
process. This process, along with the supply side review, was designed to reduce the
1

Economic and fiscal outlook

Foreword

volatility of our forecast between rounds to support a smoother policy development
process within government. Partly as a result, our pre-measures forecast displayed less
variation from round to round than has previously been the case.
•

Following the conclusion of the supply-side review, fiscal baseline review, and
confirmation of the timetable, OBR staff prepared an initial economy forecast, drawing on
data released since our previous forecast in March 2025 and incorporating our
preliminary judgements on the outlook for the economy. This economy forecast was sent
to the Treasury on 17 September.

•

Using the economic determinants from this forecast (such as the components of nominal
income and spending, unemployment, inflation, and interest rates), we commissioned
updated forecasts from the relevant government departments for the various tax and
spending items that in aggregate determine the position of the public finances. We
discussed these in detail with the officials producing them, which allowed us to investigate
proposed changes in forecasting methodology and to assess the significance of recent tax
and spending outturn data. In many cases the BRC requested changes to methodology
and/or the interpretation of recent data. This first fiscal forecast was finalised on 2
October, and we sent a note that described the main elements of it to the Chancellor the
following day.

•

As the process continued, we identified further key judgements that we would need to
make for our economy forecast. Where we thought it would be helpful, we commissioned
analysis from the relevant teams in the Treasury. We then produced a second premeasures economy forecast, which incorporated the latest data, and the economic
implications of our first fiscal forecast.

•

This second economy forecast provided the basis for the next round of fiscal forecasts.
Discussions with HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC), the Department for Work and
Pensions (DWP) and other departments, gave us the opportunity to follow up our requests
for further analysis, methodological changes, and alternative judgements from the
previous round. We finalised our second fiscal forecast on 17 October and sent a
summary of the forecast to the Chancellor on 20 October.

•

We then produced a third and final pre-measures economy forecast, in which we took on
the latest data and incorporated judgements embodied in our fiscal forecast. This final premeasures economy forecast was based on financial and energy market data averaged over
the 10 working days to 10 October. It was sent to the Treasury and other government
departments that produce tax and spending forecasts on 23 October.

•

The agreed timetable required us to close the pre-measures economy and fiscal forecasts
earlier than we have previously, to increase the time at the end of the process for the
Government to finalise the policy package on the basis of a stable forecast. Given the time
between the closure of the pre-measures economy forecast and the publication of our EFO,
we decided prior to the start of the forecast process in the summer to take a later window
for Bank Rate and gilt yields for the final pre-measures fiscal forecast, which were averaged

Foreword

over the 10 working days to 21 October. This results in very minor discrepancies between
the economy and fiscal forecast which we judge to be immaterial, and outweighed by
having a more up-to-date set of interest rate assumptions in our fiscal forecast. In practice,
the difference between interest rate assumptions used in the economy and fiscal forecasts is
very small, with interest rates in the fiscal forecast lower by an average of 0.1 percentage
points.
•

The final pre-measures fiscal forecast, incorporating these later interest rate assumptions,
was finalised on 30 October, and sent to the Chancellor the following day on 31 October.
No further adjustments were made to our economy or fiscal forecasts after this, other than
to take account of the impact of policy measures provided by the Treasury.

•

In parallel to the production of the forecast, we scrutinised the costing of individual tax
and spending measures announced since our March 2025 forecast. As usual, OBR staff
and the BRC requested further information and/or changes to almost all the draft costings
prepared by HMRC, DWP and other departments. We also undertook a process of
engagement and analysis to assess the policy measures included in the Budget that we
deemed could have specific effects on our economy forecast. This involved several rounds
of engagement with the Treasury and other government departments as both the
specification of policies, and our assessment of their impact, were refined.

•

We made an initial assessment of the economic and fiscal effects of the emerging policy
package that was provided by the Treasury on 4 November. We incorporated this
package into an initial post-measures forecast, to provide an early view on the effect of
policy measures on the economy and public finances, which we sent to the Chancellor on
10 November. This forecast round was produced using our internal ready-reckoner
models (rather than being sent to departmental forecasters).

•

In line with the agreed timetable, on 12 November the Treasury provided the final
package of measures that would cause movements in our economy forecast. We sent the
resulting final economy forecast to the Treasury on 17 November and a near-final fiscal
forecast on 18 November. Final policy decisions, that would only affect the fiscal forecast,
were returned by the Treasury on 20 November, a day later than anticipated in the
agreed timetable, and our forecast was then finalised and sent to the Treasury on 21
November.

•

The Treasury made a written request, as provided for in the MoU between us, that we
provide the Chancellor and an agreed list of her special advisers and officials with a
near-final draft of the EFO on 21 November. This allowed the Treasury to prepare the
Chancellor’s statement and accompanying documents. We also provided pre-release
access to the full and final EFO on 24 November.

•

Alongside producing the forecast, we prepared two supplementary briefing papers that
have been published at the same time as this EFO: Briefing paper No.9: Forecasting
productivity, which summarises the analysis and conclusions of our supply-side review;
and Briefing paper No.10: Accounting for the supply-side effects of policy, which provides
3

Economic and fiscal outlook

Foreword

the conclusions of our review of the criteria for scoring the supply-side effects of policies
that was recommended by our recent external review. These papers were shared with the
Treasury on 11 November and 20 October respectively.
The agreed forecast timetable was largely adhered to, with the exception of the finalisation of the
policy package. Small changes were made to the parameters of three policy measures following the
costings certification deadline, meaning that, although we have no concerns about the
methodologies used, we have not been able to certify these costings but have used the
Government’s estimates of their fiscal impact and will return to them at our next forecast. In
addition, one policy measure with direct effects on our economy forecast was altered after it had
been finalised. Had we been able to incorporate this, it would have only made a small difference to
our final economy forecast.
During the forecasting period, the BRC held dozens of scrutiny and challenge meetings with officials
from other departments, in addition to numerous further meetings at staff level and with external
stakeholders. We have been provided with all the information and analysis that we requested and
have come under no pressure from Ministers, advisers, or officials to change any of our conclusions.
The BRC met with the Chancellor on two occasions to discuss the forecast over the course of its
production (on 10 October and 30 October). A full log of our substantive contact with Ministers,
their offices and special advisers can be found on our website. This includes the list of special
advisers and officials who received the near-final draft of the EFO on 21 November.
We would be pleased to receive feedback on any aspect of the content or presentation of our
analysis. This can be sent to feedback@obr.uk.

Executive summary

Overview
1.1

Real GDP is forecast to grow by 1.5 per cent on average over the forecast, 0.3 percentage
points slower than we projected in March, due to lower underlying productivity growth. But
cumulative real wage growth and inflation over the next two years are forecast to be around
¾ and ½ a percentage point higher than in March respectively. This means that total
growth in nominal GDP over the forecast is only around 1 percentage point lower than in
March and is more tax rich, thanks to a larger share accruing to labour income and
consumption. This, combined with frozen personal tax thresholds, boosts pre-measures tax
receipts by amounts rising to £16 billion by 2029-30 relative to our March forecast. But premeasures spending is also higher in every year and by £22 billion in 2029-30 due to higher
spending by local authorities and on welfare and debt interest. The net result is a modest
medium-term deterioration in the pre-measures fiscal outlook, with borrowing £17 billion
higher this year but only £6 billion higher in 2029-30 compared to our March forecast.

1.2

Against this backdrop, Budget policies increase spending in every year and by £11 billion in
2029-30, primarily to pay for the summer reversals to welfare cuts and lift the two-child
limit in universal credit. The Budget also raises taxes by amounts rising to £26 billion in
2029-30, through freezing personal tax thresholds and a host of smaller measures, and
brings the tax take to an all-time high of 38 per cent of GDP in 2030-31. The net impact of
Budget spending and tax policies increases borrowing by £5 billion on average over the
next three years but then reduces it by £13 billion on average in the following two.

1.3

Taking forecast and policy changes together, borrowing is projected to fall from 4.5 per
cent of GDP in 2025-26 to 1.9 per cent of GDP in 2030-31. Debt rises as a share of GDP
from 95 per cent of GDP this year and ends the decade at 96 per cent of GDP, which is 2
percentage points higher than projected in March and twice the debt level of the average
advanced economy. The current balance target is met in 2029-30 with a margin that fell
from £10 billion in the March forecast, to £4 billion in the pre-measures forecast, but is then
boosted to £22 billion by Budget policies. This is close to the £21 billion average absolute
revision in the fourth year of our pre-measures forecast between fiscal events, and around
three-quarters of the £29 billion average margin set aside by previous Chancellors. But it is
only around two-fifths of the median £54 billion difference between our forecast for
borrowing and final outturn four years hence. It therefore remains a small margin
compared to the uncertainties around our economy forecast, including the outlook for
productivity, interest rates, equity prices, and earnings growth. It is also small by comparison
to the wider risks around our fiscal forecast, which include risks from the uncertain yield
from an array of complex tax changes, and pressures on welfare, health, education,
asylum, defence, and local authority budgets.

Economic and fiscal outlook

Executive summary

Economic outlook
1.4

We now forecast real GDP growth of 1.5 per cent in 2025, 0.5 percentage points faster
than in our March Economic and fiscal outlook (EFO). This is because output growth was
revised up in the second half of 2024 and growth was stronger than expected in the first
quarter of 2025, at 0.7 per cent. The latter was partly due to the temporary frontloading of
property transactions and exports, as households sought to avoid stamp duty threshold
changes and businesses tried to get ahead of tariff increases, both of which came in from
April. Growth then fell to 0.3 per cent in the second quarter, as these temporary factors
unwound, and to 0.1 per cent in the third quarter, when the Jaguar Land Rover shutdown
temporarily weighed on growth – both below our March forecast. We expect quarterly
growth to pick up only gradually in the near term as geopolitical uncertainty persists and
domestic business and consumer confidence remains subdued, including in anticipation of
further tax rises.

1.5

We have reduced our central forecast for the underlying rate of productivity growth in the
medium term to 1.0 per cent, 0.3 percentage points slower than in our March forecast. The
UK’s productivity performance has undershot our forecasts, despite several substantial
downgrades since 2010, as a significant rebound from recent negative shocks has not
materialised. The further reduction in this forecast is due to a lower forecast for underlying
total factor productivity (TFP) growth, which we now forecast at 0.8 per cent rather than 1.1
per cent in the medium term. This decision is not a reflection of any particular government
policies. Rather, it is based on our latest assessment of the UK’s productivity performance in
historical and international context; what the latest output and labour force data tell us
about the impact of shocks and underlying productivity of the economy; and how
developments in global trade policy, the sectoral composition of output, the emergence of
new technologies like artificial intelligence, and other structural trends are likely to affect the
productive potential of the UK economy in the future.1

1.6

With estimated medium-term growth in labour supply and capital deepening unchanged at
0.5 and 0.2 per cent respectively, medium-term potential output growth has been revised
down by 0.3 percentage points to 1.5 per cent. Real GDP growth is expected to be steady at
around 1.5 per cent over the forecast as TFP growth rises from 0.5 per cent this year to its
new medium-term trend rate of 0.8 per cent in 2030, offsetting a continued slowdown in
labour supply growth. The downward revision to our real GDP growth forecast – which
reduces cumulative growth over the forecast by 1.3 percentage points – is offset by upward
revisions to historical data and stronger-than-expected growth at the start of 2025, which
raise the starting level of GDP by 1.1 per cent relative to March. This means that the level of
GDP is only 0.1 per cent lower than March in 2029. We estimate that Budget policies
temporarily boost demand by 0.1 per cent next year but have no significant impact on
output by 2030.2

1

The analysis and reasoning behind our decision to reduce potential productivity growth in this forecast are set out in Briefing paper No.9:
Forecasting productivity which is published alongside this EFO.
2
Following a review of the implementation of our more transparent approach to accounting for the supply-side impacts of government
policies over the past three years, the findings of which are published alongside this EFO in Briefing paper No.10: Accounting for the
supply side effects of policy measures, we will only explicitly adjust the supply side of our economy forecast for policies or packages of
policies that increase or decrease potential output by at least 0.1 per cent by the fifth year. No policies in this Budget met this threshold.

1.7

The downward revision to productivity is not the only material change to our economy
forecast since March – we have also revised up our near-term forecast for earnings growth
and inflation. Relative to our March forecast, cumulative real wage growth over the next two
years is just under ¾ percentage points higher and CPI inflation just over ½ per cent higher
as surveys of wage settlement expectations have held up significantly more than we
expected, and there is more momentum in domestically generated inflation than we
anticipated. This means that, having risen by around 5 per cent in 2024, nominal weekly
earnings are estimated to grow at close to the same rate in 2025 before falling to around
3½ per cent in 2026, with growth around 1 percentage point higher than the March
forecast in both years. Nominal weekly earnings growth falls back further to an average of
around 2¼ per cent a year from 2027 as labour market conditions loosen, inflation drops
back, average weekly hours worked fall slightly, and companies rebuild margins and pass
on more of the recent rise in employer National Insurance contributions (NICs) to real
wages.

1.8

Greater domestically generated inflation, alongside higher food prices, mean we also
expect inflation to stay higher for longer than in March. In this forecast, higher food and
services prices push CPI inflation up to 3.5 per cent in 2025 and 2.5 per cent in 2026,
respectively 0.2 and 0.4 percentage points higher than the March forecast. These upward
pressures on prices are only partly offset by a 0.3 percentage point reduction in inflation in
2026 from Budget policy measures, primarily those that reduce household energy bills. CPI
inflation returns to the Bank’s 2 per cent target in 2027, a year later than in our March
forecast. The increase in domestically generated inflation also means that cumulative
growth in the GDP deflator is 0.5 percentage points higher than in our March forecast.

1.9

The unemployment rate has been on a gradual upward trend since a post-pandemic trough
of 3.8 per cent in 2022, and we expect it to remain close to its current rate of around 5 per
cent until 2027. It then falls back to its estimated equilibrium rate of around 4 per cent over
the forecast. The employment rate is expected to be broadly flat at around 61 per cent over
the forecast, as a cyclical decline in the unemployment rate is offset by a structural fall in the
participation rate from an ageing population and rising sickness-related inactivity. Growth
in real household disposable income per person is projected to fall from 3 per cent in
2024-25 to around ¼ per cent a year over the forecast, slightly below our March forecast
and well below the last decade’s average growth of 1 per cent a year. Weaker mediumterm real wage growth and rising taxes explain the slower growth. Real GDP per person
grows by an average of 1.1 per cent a year over the forecast, 0.3 percentage points slower
than in March due to weaker productivity growth.

1.10

Business profits are projected to fall in 2025 before picking up across the forecast, but by
less than expected in March. We forecast that the real rate of return on capital will fall from
around 12½ per cent in 2022 to a low of around 10¾ per cent in 2026 as real wage
growth and settlement expectations hold up relative to subdued productivity growth. In the
medium term, we forecast that firms are likely to try to rebuild their rate of return by keeping
real wage growth below productivity growth, so we expect the rate of return to recover to
around 11 per cent. We also project growth in business investment to be weaker over the
forecast compared to March due to continued weakness in business sentiment, lower profit
growth, and increases in long-term interest rates which have pushed up the cost of capital.

1.11

The overall impact of these changes is that growth in the nominal economy has not been
downgraded by as much as productivity, and the composition of nominal GDP growth is
more tax rich than in March. Cumulative nominal GDP growth, a key driver of tax revenues,
is only 0.9 percentage points lower than in March over the forecast, because the downward
revision to real GDP growth is partly offset by the upward revision to inflation. Moreover,
cumulative growth in corporate profits has been revised down by significantly more than

Economic and fiscal outlook

8

Executive summary

nominal GDP – by around 6 percentage points – while cumulative growth in labour income
has been revised up by 0.9 percentage points. These changes boost tax receipts, as labour
income has an effective tax rate of around 40 per cent, whereas corporate profits have an
effective tax rate of around 17 per cent. Consistent with these revisions to income, we also
now expect a more tax-rich composition of expenditure growth over the forecast. Nominal
consumption growth (which has an effective tax rate of 10 per cent) has been revised down
by less than nominal GDP, while corporate investment growth (which has a negative shortterm effective tax rate, due to investment allowances) has been revised down significantly
more than nominal GDP growth.

Fiscal outlook
1.12

The economy changes described above boost overall tax receipts relative to our March
forecast by £16 billion in 2029-30, before accounting for Budget policies. In isolation, the
reduction in productivity growth could have lowered revenues by around £16 billion in
2029-30. However, the boost to receipts from higher inflation and changes to the
composition of nominal GDP growth, set out in the previous paragraph, more than offset
this. As a result, income tax and NICs receipts are £11 billion higher than in March by
2029-30, due to higher nominal earnings growth coupled with frozen personal tax
thresholds. In addition, VAT receipts are £4 billion higher than March in 2029-30 due to
higher pre-measures consumption growth. And corporation tax receipts are little changed
relative to our March forecast thanks, in part, to lower investment growth.

1.13

The impact on public sector net borrowing of the higher pre-measures receipts forecast is
more than offset by a £22 billion increase in the pre-measures spending forecast by 202930, relative to March. Before accounting for policy, higher forecast inflation and earnings
and an increase in disability caseloads increase projected spending on welfare by £8 billion
by 2029-30. Higher inflation and interest rates increase debt interest spending by £4 billion
by 2029-30. The pre-measures forecast also includes a significant increase to local
9

Executive summary

authority spending, which increases borrowing by £8 billion in 2029-30, reflecting
substantial recent upward revisions to outturn and rapidly growing spending on special
educational needs and disabilities (SEND). Departmental spending has also been revised up
by an average of around £6 billion per year across the Spending Review period, before
accounting for policy, to reflect risks and pressures, most notably on the NHS, asylum, and
the cost of digital ID cards, for which no specific funding has been identified.
1.14

Before accounting for Budget policies, these forecast changes left borrowing £17 billion
higher this year and £6 billion higher in 2029-30. Higher spending pressures, in particular
from local authorities and on welfare, drive the substantial deterioration in borrowing this
year. This is then partly offset by higher forecast personal tax and VAT receipts from next
year onwards due to stronger nominal earnings growth and inflation. The pre-measures
deterioration in the current budget matches that of borrowing, leaving a current surplus of
around £4 billion in 2029-30, which is £6 billion lower than the £10 billion surplus forecast
at the Spring Statement. This change in borrowing since March is small compared to the
£21 billion average absolute revision in the fourth year of our pre-measures forecast.

In the face of this comparatively modest medium-term deterioration in the pre-measures
fiscal outlook, the direct effects of Budget policies increase borrowing by £6 billion next year
but reduce it by £15 billion in 2029-30. Policy measures reduce the current deficit by more
than borrowing due to the estimated impact of policy on local government and other capital
spending.

1.16

Spending policies in this Budget increase borrowing in every year, by £7 billion next year
and by £11 billion in 2029-30. They comprise:

•

Welfare measures, with a combined cost of £9 billion in 2029-30. These include the
reversals to previously announced cuts to winter fuel payments and health-related
benefits (costing £7 billion in 2029-30), and the removal of the two-child limit within
universal credit (costing £3 billion by 2029-30) which increases benefits for 560,000
families by an average of £5,310.

•

Other spending measures, which increase borrowing by £2 billion in 2026-27 and
£10 billion in 2027-28, but only £2 billion in 2029-30. These include temporarily
part-funding the renewables obligation, which costs £3 billion next year and an
average of £2 billion in 2027-28 and 2028-29, before the subsidy is removed in
2029-30; as well as changes to departmental spending which increase spending in
the near term and leave it broadly unchanged over the forecast period as a whole.

Tax increases raise £0.7 billion next year and £26 billion in 2029-30, more than offsetting
the increase in spending by the final years of the forecast. They comprise:
•

A set of personal tax rises with a combined yield of £15 billion in 2029-30. These
include: freezing tax thresholds from 2028-29 onwards, which raises £8.0 billion in
2029-30 and contributes to around 780,000 more basic-rate, 920,000 more higherrate, and 4,000 more additional-rate taxpayers by 2029-30 than in the March
forecast; charging National Insurance on salary-sacrificed pension contributions,
which raises £4.7 billion; and increasing tax rates on dividends, property and savings
income by 2 percentage points, raising £2.1 billion.

•

Other tax changes raise £11 billion by 2029-30. These include a new mileage-based
charge on electric and plug-in hybrid cars from April 2028 at around half the fuel duty
rate paid by drivers of petrol cars (raising £1.4 billion); a reduction to writing down
allowances in corporation tax (£1.5 billion); reforms to gambling taxation (£1.1
billion); changes to capital gains tax reliefs on employee ownership trusts (£0.9
billion); and tax administration, compliance and debt collection measures (£2.3
billion). These tax rises are partially offset by a further freeze to fuel duty rates until
September 2026, which costs £2.4 billion next year and £0.9 billion in the medium
term.

The indirect effects of Budget policy measures on the economy are estimated to lower
borrowing by £2 billion in 2026-27 largely thanks to impact of lower inflation on debt
interest spending. From 2027-28 onwards, the indirect effects of policy add to borrowing by
amounts rising to £5 billion in 2029-30. This is mainly due to higher debt interest spending
from additional borrowing in the early years of the forecast, and from lower receipts, as the
personal tax rises reduce consumption and lower inflation reduces nominal earnings. In
addition, we have judged that the Government’s decision to assume the full cost of SEND
within central government will lead to higher departmental spending in 2028-29 and lower
local authority spending in subsequent years.

1.19

Incorporating both pre-measures changes and the impacts of policy, National Accounts
taxes as a share of GDP are forecast to increase from 35 per cent in 2024-25 to an all-time
high of just over 38 per cent from 2029-30 onward. This would be 5 percentage points
above their pre-pandemic level. Around two-thirds of this increase in the tax take since
2019-20 comes from rising personal taxes – primarily due to previously announced
threshold freezes and employer NICs increases, and the personal tax rise package in this
Budget. The forecast for the tax take in 2029-30 is 1 per cent of GDP higher than in our
March forecast, with two-fifths of this increase coming from our pre-measures forecast
revisions and three-fifths from the tax measures in this Budget.

1.20

Spending as a share of GDP is forecast to rise from 44 per cent in 2024-25 to 45 per cent
in 2025-26 and then fall back to 44 per cent of GDP by 2030-31. This would also be 5
percentage points above its pre-pandemic level. The projected fall in spending over the
forecast period mainly comes from slower growth in departmental resource spending, which
falls by 0.5 per cent of GDP; reductions in spending on a number of time-limited items,
such as the Infected Blood and Post Office compensation schemes; and a rising surplus on
unfunded public service pension schemes. These declines more than offset a forecast rise in
welfare spending (of 0.3 percentage points) and debt interest (of 0.1 percentage points).

1.21

Borrowing as a share of GDP is projected to fall from 5.1 per cent last year, to 4.5 per cent
this year, and then decline to 1.9 per cent of GDP in 2030-31. Compared to March, it is
estimated to be higher by £12 billion (0.4 per cent of GDP) in 2024-25 and £21 billion (0.7
per cent of GDP) higher in 2025-26, but still lower by £6 billion (0.2 per cent of GDP) in
2029-30. In-year forecast revisions and policy changes mean that borrowing this year is
forecast to be around 5 per cent of GDP for the fifth year since the pandemic. And the
profile of the planned medium-term reduction in borrowing has largely been shifted back a
year relative to March with more of the weight of consolidation coming in 2028-29 and
2029-30. Around three-quarters of the planned reduction in borrowing over the next five
years now comes from tax increases, compared with two-thirds in Autumn Budget 2024.

Economic and fiscal outlook

Executive summary

1.22

Public sector net debt (PSND) is forecast to rise from 95.0 per cent of GDP this year to a
peak of 97.0 per cent of GDP in 2028-29. It declines slightly to 96.1 per cent of GDP in
2030-31 mainly due to a one-off Bank of England repayment. Compared to the restated
March forecast, PSND is 1.5 per cent of GDP higher on average over the forecast, mainly
due to higher borrowing in the near term. Underlying debt, excluding the Bank of England,
follows a similar trend to forecasts over the past few years, with higher near-term borrowing
meaning debt is initially forecast to rise and it then stabilises later but at a higher level than
previously forecast.

Performance against the Government’s fiscal targets
1.23

In our central forecast, the Government’s fiscal mandate for the current budget to be in
balance in 2029-30 is met by a margin of £22 billion (0.6 per cent of GDP), which is £12
billion (0.3 per cent of GDP) more than in March. Underlying forecast changes reduced
headroom against the current budget by £6 billion – so the fiscal mandate would have been
met by around £4 billion in the pre-measures forecast. Budget policies then improved the
current budget by around £18 billion so that the mandate is met with a bit more than
double the £10 billion margin in the previous two forecasts.

1.24

The probability of meeting the fiscal mandate is 59 per cent, up from 54 per cent in March.
This reflects the larger projected current surplus in the target year and also the target year
moving a year forward in the forecast period compared to March. The margin against the
fiscal mandate is roughly equal to the £21 billion average absolute pre-measures forecast
revision to borrowing in four years’ time. It is three-quarters of the £29 billion average
margin maintained by previous Chancellors. But it is only two-fifths of the £54 billion
median difference between our four-year forecast for borrowing and actual outturn. The

Economic and fiscal outlook

Executive summary

large difference between forecast and outturn several years ahead in large part reflects the
scale of unforeseen shocks that have hit the economy over the past couple of decades and
the scale of the fiscal policy response to them.

The supplementary target for public sector net financial liabilities (PSNFL) to be falling in
2029-30 is also met in the central forecast, by a margin of £24 billion (0.7 per cent of
GDP). This is £9 billion (0.3 per cent of GDP) more than in March. PSNFL is forecast to rise
from 83.1 per cent of GDP this year to a peak of 83.7 per cent in 2028-29 and falls
thereafter to 82.2 per cent in 2030-31. Based on historical forecast errors, the probability of
meeting the supplementary target is 52 per cent, up from 51 per cent in March.

Economic and fiscal outlook

Executive summary

Risks and uncertainties
1.26

These margins are larger than at recent events but remain small in the context of the
significant risks and uncertainties around the central forecast. While the pre-measures
change to overall borrowing in this forecast compared to March was relatively small, this
was the net effect of significant offsetting changes within our economy forecasts and
between tax and spending, which may not recur in future forecasts. And previous forecasts
have seen significant changes to the fiscal outlook from the impact of major economic
shocks and the crystallisation of specific risks to spending or receipts.

1.27

Key risks to our economy forecast, explored in Chapter 7, include:

1.28

•

Productivity growth remains one of the most important, but uncertain, judgements in
our economy and fiscal forecasts. We have revised down our assessment of mediumterm productivity growth from 1.3 per cent to 1 per cent. If productivity growth were to
be 0.5 per cent in each year of the forecast, similar to growth over the past 15 years
and around half our revised medium-term trend, the current budget would be in deficit
by £6 billion in 2029-30 compared to a surplus of £22 billion in our central forecast.
If productivity were to grow more quickly than in our central forecast with growth
reaching 1.5 per cent in the medium term, based in part on a more optimistic scenario
for the impact of AI, the current budget would be in a surplus of £59 billion in 202930.

•

Bank Rate and gilt yields have varied by around 0.6 percentage points since March.
Our sensitivity analysis suggests that a 1 percentage point increase in Bank Rate and
gilt yields would reduce the current surplus by £16 billion in 2029-30, reducing the
margin against the fiscal mandate. A 1 percentage point decrease in interest rates
would increase the margin by a similar amount.

•

UK equity prices are, on average, 4 per cent higher than in our March forecast. The
price-to-earnings ratio for US equities is close to the levels seen during the dotcom
bubble and post-pandemic rally in 2021. In our ‘global correction’ scenario, UK and
world equity prices fall 35 per cent in 2026-27, and remain lower than in our central
forecast over the medium term. This reduces UK GDP by 0.6 per cent at its peak and
0.1 per cent over the medium term. The decline in real GDP leads to a £16 billion (0.4
per cent of GDP) deterioration in the current budget and £121 billion (3.7 per cent of
GDP) increase in PSNFL by 2029-30. In the ‘limited UK contagion’ scenario, UK equity
prices fall by 15 per cent in 2026-27 and the peak fall in UK GDP is 0.5 per cent. This
results in a £9 billion (0.2 per cent of GDP) and £61 billion (2.1 per cent) increase in
the current budget deficit and PSNFL in 2029-30 respectively.

Key risks to the medium-term fiscal forecast include:
•

Local authority borrowing has increased by around £7 billion a year in this forecast
compared to March, reflecting recent upward revisions to outturn and financial

Economic and fiscal outlook

16

Executive summary

pressures including from the costs of SEND. The ‘statutory override’, which allows local
authorities to disregard deficits caused by financing SEND provision when meeting
their requirement to balance budgets, is due to end in 2027-28. At this point the stock
of these deficits is estimated to reach a total of £14 billion, and as a result many local
authorities would likely be unable to meet their balanced budget requirement. The
Government has not set out how this fiscal risk would be addressed.

1.29

•

With inflation now forecast to be higher than when Spending Review envelopes were
set in March 2025, overall real departmental spending growth would have been 0.1
percentage points lower on a pre-measures basis. In addition, the Government has
stated that the full cost of SEND provision will be absorbed within departmental
budgets in 2028-29, but no savings have been identified to offset the estimated £6
billion pressure this will create. Other spending risks include: the impact on the NHS
budget of further strikes and negotiations over NHS pharmaceutical spending; the
assumption that the Home Office will reduce small boat arrivals and end the use of
hotels for asylum seekers by mid-2028, and deliver savings on the asylum budget of
£1.1 billion; the unfunded cost of digital ID cards at a provisional annual cost of £0.6
billion over the Spending Review period; and the commitment for defence spending to
reach 3.5 per cent of GDP by 2035, which would cost an additional £32 billion in
today’s money.

•

There also remains significant uncertainty around the future costs of welfare spending
due to the growth of disability and health caseloads, which have increased very
sharply since the pandemic. We assume in the forecast that these caseloads will
continue to rise but at a slower pace than recently. If growth instead continued at the
rate seen since the pandemic, this would increase spending in 2029-30 by a further
£11 billion.

•

The tax-to-GDP ratio is forecast to increase to an all-time high of 38.3 per cent of GDP
in 2030-31. A higher level of the tax take increases the risk that incentives within the
tax system distort or constrain economic activity by more than expected. The yield from
the personal tax threshold freezes, extended in this Budget, is very sensitive to future
inflation and nominal earnings growth. If nominal earnings growth was 1.8
percentage points lower than forecast, this would reduce personal tax revenues by
2029-30 by £19 billion.

At this Budget the Government has taken action to mitigate some fiscal risks that we have
highlighted previously. The probability of the fiscal mandate being met is now 59 per cent,
its highest level since before the pandemic, and with a margin of £22 billion, double that in
March. The introduction of the new mileage-based charge on electric cars will offset around
one-quarter of the 0.6 per cent of GDP in revenue set to be lost from fuel duty by 2050 due
to the transition to electric vehicles. The target year for the fiscal mandate is now the fourth
year of the forecast (2029-30), rather than the fifth year, which reduces the scope for fiscal
consolidation to be further postponed. And the target year will move to the third year of the

17

Economic and fiscal outlook

Executive summary

forecast from next year. The Government has also set out a further set of reforms to
manage balance sheet risks.
1.30

While this Budget addresses some fiscal risks and increases the margin held against the
Government’s fiscal targets, it still leaves the UK public finances relatively vulnerable to
future shocks. Even if the Government were to meet its fiscal rules and reduce overall
borrowing to below the roughly 2½ per cent of GDP it invests by the end of the decade, this
would only reduce the UK’s deficit to the level that the average advanced economy had
already achieved several years ago. And it would only just be enough to leave the UK’s
debt, which has nearly tripled since the start of the century, stabilising at 96 per cent of GDP
by the end of the decade. That would leave the UK with a debt-to-GDP ratio that is around
twice the advanced-economy average and the sixth-highest among advanced economies.
And the UK would still be devoting more of national income to paying the interest on that
debt than at almost any time in its post-war history.

This chapter describes our latest economy forecast, summarised in Table 2.1, including:
•

key forecast judgements (from paragraph 2.2);

•

conditioning assumptions, including interest rates, commodity and equity prices, the
global economy, and the exchange rate (from paragraph 2.4);

•

the impact of fiscal policy on the forecast (from paragraph 2.14);

•

the forecast for potential output and its components (from paragraph 2.16);

•

real GDP and the output gap (from paragraph 2.27);

•

inflation (from paragraph 2.32);

•

the labour market including employment, unemployment, and earnings (from
paragraph 2.37);

•

the composition of economic activity, including households, businesses, government,
trade and the current account, and the housing market (from paragraph 2.44);

•

nominal GDP (from paragraph 2.62); and

•

how our forecast compares to recent external forecasts (from paragraph 2.66).

Key forecast judgements
2.2

Relative to our March forecast, the economic outlook is characterised by somewhat weaker
medium-term real GDP growth, higher near-term inflation, and a more fiscally favourable
composition of nominal GDP growth. We have revised down our central forecast for
underlying medium-term productivity growth by 0.3 percentage points to 1.0 per cent after
taking stock of its historical evolution and potential drivers over the forecast (see Box 2.1).
With our estimate of potential labour supply growth broadly unchanged from March, real
GDP growth now averages 1.5 per cent between 2026 and 2029, down from 1.8 per cent
in March. At the same time, the ONS has revised up the level of GDP in 2024 by 0.6 per
cent, and we have raised our central estimate for real GDP growth in 2025 from 1.0 to 1.5
per cent. The net effect of the higher starting point for, but lower growth in, real GDP over
the next five years is to leave its level largely unchanged in 2029 relative to our March
central projection.1

1

Due to the change in the ONS base year, the levels are not directly comparable to our March forecast. Where the series are not
directly comparable, all levels comparisons index both series to the final quarter of 2019 (quarterly series) or to 2019 (annual series).

19

Economic and fiscal outlook

Economic outlook

2.3

In terms of the nominal economy, lower real GDP growth is partly offset by higher inflation
and we expect the composition of nominal growth over the forecast to be more tax rich than
March. This is mainly because we have revised up our forecast for real wage growth and
CPI inflation in 2026 by 2/3 per cent and 0.4 per cent respectively. This reflects the fact that
surveys of wage settlement expectations have held up significantly more than we expected
and there are signs of more momentum in domestically generated inflation than we
anticipated in March. Policy measures in this Budget reduce CPI inflation by 0.3 percentage
points in 2026. Cumulative growth in nominal GDP from 2025-26 to 2029-30 is 0.9
percentage points lower than in March, but its composition is more skewed toward labour
income and away from corporate profits. Because labour income has a higher effective tax
rate and personal tax thresholds are frozen, meaning fiscal drag brings more people into
higher tax bands, this more than offsets the negative impact of lower nominal GDP growth
on nominal tax receipts. However, significantly higher pre-measures spending, due to
higher inflation and other pressures, means there is still a modest deterioration in borrowing
over the medium term relative to March, before taking account of government policies.

Our economy forecast is conditioned on market expectations for interest rates in the 10

•

Market participants expected Bank Rate to fall from its current level of 4 per cent to a
low of 3.6 per cent at end-2026. The expected rate then rises gradually, returning to 4

per cent by end-2030. Compared to our March forecast, Bank Rate is 0.2 percentage
points lower in 2026 and 0.1 percentage points higher in 2029 (Chart 2.1, left panel).
Since March, Bank Rate expectations for 2026 have ranged from 3.4 to 4.0 per cent.
•

2.5

The 10-year gilt yield was 4.8 per cent and the 20-year gilt yield was 5.6 per cent.
Compared to March, near-term yields are slightly lower but long-term yields are
higher, with 10-year yields up 0.3 percentage points and 20-year yields up 0.5
percentage points (Chart 2.1, right panel). Market participants expected the 10-year
gilt yield to rise to 5.8 per cent by 2030. This would be the highest level since 2000,
but still lower than the longer-term average yield since 1980 of 6.0 per cent. Interest
rates on government bonds have remained volatile since March, particularly at longer
maturities, with 20-year yields ranging from 5.1 to 5.7 per cent.

As explained in the Foreword, given the time between closing the pre-measures economy
forecast and publishing the Economic and fiscal outlook (EFO), we have taken a later
reading of market expectations for interest rates to use in our pre-measures fiscal forecast.
These are based on the 10 working days to 21 October. This ensures that our fiscal forecast
uses more up-to-date market expectations. Differences compared to the numbers used in
our economy forecast were relatively small, with both Bank Rate expectations and gilt yields
on average 0.1 percentage points lower (dashed lines in Chart 2.1). Interest rates have
fluctuated since we closed our pre-measures forecast, but as of 21 November they were
broadly where they were in the 10 days to 21 October.

Economic and fiscal outlook

Economic outlook

2.6

UK government bond yields are now the highest in the G7, and second highest among the
advanced economies, after Iceland.2 A rise in interest rates has been a common feature
across advanced economies over the past three years, however the increase in UK rates
since 2021 has outstripped that of its peers (Chart 2.2). Between the start of 2021 and this
October, the average 10-year government bond yield for advanced economies (excluding
the UK) has risen 2.8 percentage points (from 0.2 to 3.1 per cent) and the 10-year US
Treasury yield has also increased by 3.0 percentage points (from 1.1 to 4.0 per cent). Over
the same period, the 10-year UK gilt yield has increased by 4.2 percentage points (from 0.4
to 4.6 per cent). This means, since 2021, the differential between UK and other advanced
economies has increased by 1.4 percentage points, while the differential relative to the US
has risen by 1.3 percentage points.

2.7

The much higher increase in UK government financing costs than in other advanced
economies likely reflects several factors:
•

First, the UK has experienced higher and more persistent inflation since the Russian
invasion of Ukraine sparked a Europe-wide energy crisis. Annual inflation peaked
across advanced economies in 2022, with UK CPI reaching 9.1 per cent, slightly
above the 8.8 per cent average for advanced economies. UK inflation has remained
elevated since then and is expected to average 3.5 per cent in 2025, 0.9 percentage
points higher than the average of advanced economies at 2.6 per cent.

•

Second, the UK has seen a much larger increase in total government debt and has run
more persistent fiscal deficits than other advanced economies. A series of global
economic shocks including Covid and the energy crisis have hit the UK particularly
hard among advanced economies. Between 2019 and 2024, government debt as a
share of GDP rose 18 percentage points in the UK but only 3 percentage points on
average among advanced economies. In 2024, the UK government deficit was 5.7 per
cent of GDP – the fourth highest among advanced economies, and three times higher
than the advanced economy average of 1.8 per cent (see Chapter 6).

•

Third, the UK has experienced a significant fall in domestic demand for government
debt. The decline of defined benefit pension schemes and the Bank of England’s shift
from quantitative easing to quantitative tightening have reduced the gilt holdings of
pension funds and of the central bank respectively. This has shifted the composition of
demand for gilts towards more price-sensitive overseas buyers, as highlighted in our
2025 Fiscal risks and sustainability report (FRS). The FRS analysis found that expected
shifts in gilt demand away from domestic pension funds towards overseas and other
investors over the next fifty years could push up the overall interest rate on UK
government debt by 0.8 percentage points.

2

The advanced economies are: Andorra, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia,
Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta,
Netherlands, New Zealand, Portugal, Singapore, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK, and the USA. Iceland’s
10-year government bond yield stood at 6.5 per cent on 19 November.

Equity prices
2.8

Equity prices, measured by the FTSE All-Share index, rose 10 per cent in the first three
quarters of 2025. We assume equity prices grow in line with nominal GDP over the forecast
period, leaving them 4 per cent higher on average than in our March forecast.

2.9

Growth in global equity prices, driven by US equities, has outpaced growth in corporate
earnings so far this year, with the S&P 500 price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio reaching 28 in the
third quarter. This level has only been reached twice this century: during the dotcom bubble
in the early 2000s and the post-pandemic rally in 2021, both of which were followed by a
fall in equity prices (of around 46 per cent and 25 per cent, respectively). UK P/E ratios
appear to be closer to historic averages, with the P/E ratio of the FTSE All-Share index at 15
in the third quarter, just under its post-2010 average of 16. However, global equity markets
are highly correlated, particularly during periods of stress, and the IMF’s October 2025
World Economic Outlook (WEO) highlights the risk of a price correction to US equities, which
could have a negative impact on UK equities. While market turbulence is hard to anticipate,
a large global equity price correction poses a downside risk to both our economy and fiscal
forecast. We explore the potential impact of a fall in global equity prices in Chapter 7.

World economy, trade, and the exchange rate
2.11

Our forecast for the world economy is based on the IMF’s October 2025 WEO. Global GDP
is forecast to grow 3.2 and 3.1 per cent in 2025 and 2026, respectively. This is 0.1 and 0.2
percentage points lower than our March forecast, which did not fully incorporate early
developments in US and global trade policy. The IMF’s latest WEO includes trade policy up
to the start of September, at which point the US’s weighted average statutory tariff rate
levied on all trading partners stood at around 19 per cent, 16 percentage points higher
than at the end of 2024. The IMF expects these higher barriers to trade to weigh on global
growth, though it notes the world economy has proven more resilient than expected to date.

2.12

We expect global trade growth to slow from 3.7 per cent in 2024 to 2.3 per cent in 2026,
broadly in line with the IMF’s forecast. Growth in 2026 is 1.0 percentage point lower than in
March, and an average of 0.2 percentage points lower over the rest of the forecast. Global
trade intensity declines over the medium term from 57.2 per cent in 2023 to 53.6 per cent
in 2030. Compared to our March forecast, growth in UK export markets is 0.7 percentage
points higher in 2025, as foreign importers brought activity forward to avoid higher tariffs,
but averages 0.2 percentage points lower over the rest of the forecast.

2.13

The trade-weighted sterling effective exchange rate has strengthened by around 1 per cent
since our March forecast. While the pound has appreciated against the dollar by around 8
per cent, it has depreciated against the euro by around 4 per cent.

Fiscal policy
2.14

Compared to our March forecast, public sector net borrowing is higher as share of GDP in
most years of the forecast. It is projected to fall from around 5 per cent of GDP in 2024-25
to a little under 2 per cent of GDP by 2030-31. The primary balance (public sector noninterest revenue minus non-interest expenditure) moves from a deficit of around 2¼ per
cent of GDP to a surplus of around 1¼ per cent of GDP over the same period. As set out in
Chapter 6, the borrowing reduction over the forecast is driven mainly by an increase in tax
as a share of GDP, while public spending also declines slightly as a share of GDP.

2.15

Policy measures in this Budget increase borrowing in the near term, mainly through
increases to spending, and then reduce borrowing in the medium term primarily through
increases to taxation. This means that, relative to March, the fiscal consolidation starts from
a higher borrowing level and is more backloaded, with measures pushing a greater share
of the consolidation later in the forecast, to 2028-29 and 2029-30. The measures
temporarily raise aggregate demand and our central estimate of the real GDP level by 0.1
percentage point in 2026-27 but have no lasting impact on the level of GDP by 2030-31.
This is discussed in more detail in Chapter 3.

Economic outlook

Potential output, productivity, and labour supply
2.16

In our central forecast, potential output growth in 2029 is 0.3 percentage points lower than
in March, at 1.5 per cent. This reflects a reduction in our forecast of underlying mediumterm total factor productivity (TFP) growth from 1.1 per cent in March to 0.8 per cent in this
forecast. Our forecasts for capital deepening and labour supply growth in 2029 are broadly
unchanged at 0.2 and 0.5 per cent respectively. We set out the reasoning for, and analysis
behind, our new productivity assumption in Briefing paper No. 9: Forecasting productivity,
published alongside this EFO and summarised in Box 2.1.

2.17

Our central forecast sees potential output growth slow from 1.8 per cent in 2025 to 1.3 per
cent in 2026, before picking up to 1.5 per cent by 2030 (Chart 2.5). The slowdown next
year partly reflects a further fall in levels of net migration, which affects labour supply and
aggregate output but has a much smaller impact on output per person. Potential output
growth picks up over the rest of the forecast thanks to a recovery in TFP growth, which rises
from 0.3 per cent in 2026 to 0.8 per cent in 2030.

2.18

The central estimate of the level of potential output in 2029 is broadly unchanged from
March, as weaker growth over the forecast is offset by a higher starting point. Historical
revisions to ONS data left our estimate of potential output in 2024 0.6 per cent higher than
in March. Alongside stronger-than-expected real GDP outturns in the first half of 2025 and
a little-changed output gap, this means we expect the level of potential output to be 1.1 per
cent higher in 2025 than we projected in March. Much of the upward revision to the starting
level of potential output is due to our higher estimate for the historical trend employment
rate, as the ONS measure of actual employment was 60.9 per cent in the middle of 2025,
0.4 percentage points higher than we projected in March. Slower growth in productivity over
the forecast period then brings the level of potential output back into line with our March
forecast by 2029 (Chart 2.6).

Productivity
2.19

Our central forecast for trend productivity growth now rises from 0.3 per cent in 2024 and
0.7 per cent in 2025 to reach our revised medium-term assumption of 1.0 per cent in 2030
(Chart 2.7, left panel). The pick-up in productivity growth over the forecast period is based
on judgements about the effect that the fading of some past negative shocks, the impact of
artificial intelligence technology, and a boost from planning reforms announced in March
2025 have on TFP growth. The contribution of capital deepening is expected to be broadly
flat. Our medium-term assumption for trend productivity growth of 1.0 per cent is
significantly lower than the pre-financial crisis decade (1998-2007) average of 2.1 per cent
but higher than the post-financial crisis decade (2010-2019) average of 0.6 per cent.

Economic and fiscal outlook

Economic outlook

2.20

Productivity growth is inherently difficult to forecast, and the outlook is subject to significant
uncertainty. Differences across data sets remain a key challenge, with sizeable ONS
revisions to both the numerator (real GDP) and the denominator (total hours worked) in
recent years. Box 2.1 sets out our revised central judgement for medium-term trend
productivity growth, alongside plausible upside and downside scenarios. The fiscal
implications of these alternative productivity scenarios are discussed in Chapter 7.

Box 2.1: Forecasting productivity
The likely rate of productivity growth is one of the most important judgements in our economic
and fiscal forecasts. Alongside this EFO, we have published Briefing paper No.9: Forecasting
productivity, which sets out our latest view of trend productivity growth. This box sets out key
findings from the paper and scenarios for future productivity growth.
We have revised down our central estimate of underlying medium-term productivity growth from
1.3 per cent to 1.0 per cent in this forecast. This judgement is based on assessments of:
•

the UK’s productivity performance over long periods, alongside comparisons with other
major advanced economies;

•

what successive vintages of official output and labour force data imply about underlying
productivity and the impact of economic shocks in recent years; and

•

structural changes affecting the UK’s past and future productive potential, including
developments in global trade policy, shifts in the composition of output, and underlying
trends including the rise of artificial intelligence (AI).

Historically, there have been points when the trajectory of productivity growth changes across
eras, while sudden rises or falls are typically followed by some reversion to that era’s trajectory. It
is easier to identify these eras looking backward than to characterise current or future growth.
UK productivity growth has clearly been much lower since 2008. Annual productivity growth,
defined as real GDP growth per hour worked for the whole economy, averaged 2.1 per cent
between 1998 and 2007, 0.6 per cent from 2010 to 2019, and 0.4 per cent from 2020 to
2024. The productivity slowdown has been global, but the UK has seen the largest fall in the G7
(Chart A, left panel). We have previously made downward revisions to our trend productivity
forecast in response to shocks and the period of persistently weak productivity growth since
2008. The 0.3 percentage point revision we have made to medium-term productivity growth is
significant, though not as large as the 0.5 percentage point revision we made in November
2017. Looking at previous forecast changes in five-year cumulative trend productivity growth,
there are five other forecasts where we have made downward revisions of a similar or larger
magnitude to the one in this forecast.

The latest downward revision to our central productivity growth forecast partly reflects updated
ONS estimates for the path of output and hours worked. Based on earlier vintages of data,
measured productivity growth after the pandemic appeared to be rising toward our previous
medium-term trend assumption that TFP growth would return to halfway between its pre- and
post-financial crisis averages. But the productivity picture has become somewhat clearer, though
not stronger, more recently. According to Labour Force Survey (LFS)-based ONS data, average
annual growth in GDP per hour worked between the second quarter of 2023 and the second
quarter of 2025 averaged -0.5 per cent. Alternative productivity estimates, which account for the
sample bias in the LFS by using wider labour market evidence, suggest average productivity
growth over this period was positive though no stronger than in the 2010-2019 period.a
Therefore, on a range of measures productivity growth has remained tepid, several years on
from the shocks of Covid and the energy crisis, and a decade-and-a-half from the financial
crisis. This ongoing weakness makes it less likely that a substantial and rapid productivity growth
rebound, as seen after previous shocks, will now materialise as the Covid and energy price
shocks retreat into history. Rather, it suggests persistent weakness in productivity growth relative
to the pre-financial crisis period is more likely to reflect underlying structural trends. In particular:
•

UK and global productivity growth between the early 1990s and mid-2000s was likely
boosted by rapid increases in trade as a share of GDP. UK trade intensity has stagnated
since 2008, and we expect it to fall in the coming years due to the recent resurgence in
global protectionism on top of the enduring effects of Brexit. This is set to weigh on
productivity growth for the reasons set in in Annex C of the briefing paper.

•

Sectoral factors in the UK economy are also likely to continue to drag on productivity
growth (Chart A, right panel). Falling contributions from the previously more productive
finance, manufacturing, and information and communications technologies (ICT) sectors

29

Economic and fiscal outlook

Economic outlook

since the mid-2000s are unlikely to reverse in the coming years or be offset by a rebound
in productivity in other sectors. Our analysis suggests AI will likely provide a smaller boost
to productivity growth over the next five years than the ICT revolution did before 2008.
•

Other underlying trends should also weigh on productivity growth, including increased
employment in the relatively less productive health and social work sectors as the
population ages, slowing growth in the number of people entering higher education, and
the negative impacts of climate change and the near-term costs of the net zero transition.

We nonetheless still expect productivity growth to rise from its recently depressed rate over the
forecast. This acceleration over the medium term reflects our judgement that:
•

Part of the recent weakness is from temporary factors arising from the major shocks the
UK economy has experienced over the past 15 years. As the lingering effects of these
fade, we continue to expect productivity growth to pick up, but less sharply than before.

•

We also expect AI to begin having a positive effect on productivity growth within the
forecast period. There is significant uncertainty around both the size and timing of this
effect. Our central estimate is that it will build over time as adoption grows to reach an
estimated 0.2 percentage points by our five-year forecast horizon. The productivity impact
of AI beyond that point could be larger, as explored in Annex B of the briefing paper.

The downward revision to our medium-term productivity growth estimate takes it closer to those
of other forecasters, both for the UK and peer countries. Our November 2025 forecast of 1.0
per cent medium-term productivity growth is at the top end of the range of external forecasts for
the UK, where several other forecasts cluster including the Bank of England, IMF, and NIESR. It
also is in the middle of the range of official forecasts for comparable countries.
While productivity growth is one of our most impactful forecast variables for the public finances,
it is also one of the most uncertain. To illustrate uncertainty around this central forecast, we
present two scenarios. We explore their fiscal implications in Chapter 7.
•

In our upside scenario, more of the recent weakness in productivity growth was due to
temporary shocks, and there is a larger boost from AI, pushing potential productivity
growth up to 1.5 per cent in the medium term.

•

In the downside scenario, productivity growth stays around its post-financial crisis
average of 0.5 per cent over the forecast.

This measure uses an estimate for employment based the average of three sources: Resolution Foundation estimates which draw on
real-time information (RTI) payroll employee and self-employment tax data, the Bank of England’s underlying employment measure,
and the Workforce Jobs survey. This is then multiplied by the LFS estimate of average hours worked, adjusted slightly to account for
some known LFS-related biases, to derive total hours worked.

Labour supply
2.21

Labour supply growth is expected to slow over the forecast from 1 per cent this year to
around ½ a per cent over the medium term. This is broadly unchanged from March, and
the slowdown reflects further falls in net migration from historically high levels and the effect
of the ageing population on average hours and participation. We have revised up the
starting point for labour supply (trend total hours worked), mainly based on a reassessment
of historical trend participation following improvements to ONS data which has seen the
level recently converge with alternative measures. This leaves the level of labour supply 0.9
per cent higher at the end of the forecast than in March. Personal tax measures announced
in this Budget are likely to reduce labour supply, but the estimated effect is below our new
significance threshold of a 0.1 per cent change to the level of potential output by the fifth
year of the forecast, so we have not explicitly adjusted our forecast for them (see Chapter 3).

Adult population
2.22

The size of the adult population is forecast to rise from 56.2 million in 2025 to 58.3 million
in 2030. The Labour Force Survey (LFS) outturn for the adult population in the second
quarter of 2025 was 63,000 higher than we expected in March. This difference is largely
maintained across our forecast, with the adult population growing at a similar pace to our
March forecast, averaging 410,000 more people a year.

2.23

Net migration has been the main driver of adult population growth in recent years and
contributes to around three-quarters of the increase in population across the forecast

period. From an estimated record high of 873,000 in 2022, net migration fell back to an
estimated 431,000 in 2024, around 25,000 lower than we expected in March.3 Net
migration is expected to fall further to around 262,000 in the year to mid-2026. This is
driven by the tightening of visa rules in recent years and a rise in emigration, especially
among students, following several years of elevated immigration. Net migration is then
projected to rise to reach 340,000 by the end of the forecast, consistent with the ONS
‘migration category variant’ that also underpinned our March forecast.4
2.24

Our net migration forecast is unchanged from March, as we judge developments since then
are largely offsetting. Our immigration forecast incorporates further reductions due to the
Immigration White Paper measures enacted to date, including tighter eligibility requirements
for skilled worker visas and the end of the care visa route. But lower emigration over the
medium term offsets these effects, as the latest evidence suggests immigrant stay rates in the
UK under the new migration system have risen more than we assumed in March.5,6

Participation rate
2.25

The trend labour force participation rate is forecast to gradually fall from 63.5 per cent in
2024 to 63.4 per cent in 2029, similar to our March forecast. Declining participation is
driven by an ageing population and rising inactivity due to long-term sickness – the latter is
also reflected in our forecast for a rise in incapacity benefits caseloads (see Chapter 5 for

3

Revised migration data released after our pre-measures forecast was finalised suggests the record high was 891,000 in 2022, with net
migration falling back to 345,000 in 2024, around 110,000 lower than we expected in March. For more detail, see ONS, Improving
long-term international migration statistics, updating our methods and estimates: November 2025, November 2025.
4
The LFS is based on the ONS ‘principal population’ projection from January 2024, which assumed much higher flows of net migration
in 2025 than the latest outturns. For more detail, see ONS, Impact of reweighting on Labour Force Survey key indicators, December 2024.

Data revisions that were published after our pre-measures forecast lowered British net migration, presenting a risk to our forecast.
Further risks could arise from potential government policy changes, including the ongoing consultations on indefinite leave to remain and
the stated intention to consult on asylum policies.

more details).7 These factors are partly offset by three upward pressures on participation: a
rise in the state pension age from 66 to 67 between 2026 and 2028; falling birth rates and
childcare policy measures lowering inactivity due to childcare; and the continuing inflow of
new migrants, who are more likely to be of working age than the domestic population.
2.26

We have revised up our estimate of the starting trend participation and employment rates by
0.5 percentage points in 2024 and 2025, based on the latest ONS data. LFS sample sizes
have recovered recently, so we judge the survey is now producing more reliable estimates of
employment levels. The latest figures are more consistent with other sources, such as payroll
data, as discussed in paragraph 2.37. This means total employment now rises from 33.9
million in 2025 to 35.2 million in 2029, a similar increase to our March projection. We
expect trend average hours worked to fall slightly over the forecast, from 32.0 hours in
2025 to 31.8 hours in 2029, broadly unchanged from our March forecast. This steady
reduction in average hours worked reflects population ageing, as older people work fewer
hours on average.

Real GDP and the output gap
Real GDP
2.27

Real GDP growth in the second half of 2024 was revised up and growth in the first quarter
of 2025 surprised on the upside relative to our March forecast, so we have raised our 2025
growth estimate by 0.5 percentage points, to 1.5 per cent. Temporary frontloading of
exports and property transactions, ahead of US tariff increases and stamp duty threshold
changes respectively, helped boost first-quarter growth to 0.7 per cent. Growth in the
second quarter of 2025 slowed to 0.3 per cent as those temporary factors unwound. GDP
growth fell further in the third quarter of 2025 to 0.1 per cent, partly due to the shutdown of
Jaguar Land Rover operations in September.8 The second and third quarter figures were a
combined 0.4 percentage points below our March forecast. We expect growth to only pick
up slightly in the fourth quarter, as business and consumer confidence remain subdued,
including in anticipation of further tax rises. The level of GDP in 2024 has been revised up
0.6 per cent since our March forecast, partly due to the Quarterly National Accounts
consistent with the Blue Book 2025 (described in more detail in Box 2.2). These together
leave the level of real GDP in 2025 1.1 per cent higher than expected in March.

2.28

Subdued growth in the second half of 2025 means we have lowered real GDP growth in
2026 by 0.5 percentage points to 1.4 per cent in our central forecast. It then stabilises at
1.5 per cent a year over the rest of the decade, supported in the near term by a closing
negative output gap, aided by loosening monetary policy, and, in the medium term,
supported by trend productivity growth rising to its medium-term rate. Compared to March,
real GDP growth between 2026 and 2029 averages 0.3 percentage points a year lower.

The first estimate of GDP was released after we finalised our forecast and was 0.1 percentage points below our expectations due to a
downward revision to growth in August. Incorporating this outturn would not have had a material effect on our forecast.

period leaves the level of real GDP in 2029 largely unchanged from our March forecast.
The near-term fiscal loosening in this Budget temporarily raises our central estimate of real
GDP growth from 1.4 to 1.5 per cent in 2026-27 but has no impact on the level of real
GDP by 2030-31.

2.29

There are significant risks on either side of our central forecast for real GDP growth. Based
on the distribution of historical errors around our central forecast, there is a roughly one-infive chance that 2026 growth will be negative and a similar chance it could exceed 2½ per
cent (Chart 2.10). At the forecast horizon, there is a one-in-five chance that growth could be
higher than 4¼ per cent or lower than -1¼ per cent. Productivity growth remains one of the
largest potential drivers of variance around our central forecast, with the upside and
downside scenarios in Box 2.1 corresponding to ½ a percentage point higher and lower
real GDP growth in 2030. Significant risks also arise from our conditioning assumptions,
notably interest rates, equity prices, and uncertainty around geopolitical tensions and global
trade developments (as explored in our July 2022 FRS and March 2025 EFO).

Real GDP per person is expected to increase by 1.0 per cent in 2025, and by 1.1 per cent a
year on average over the forecast. Growth in 2025 is 0.7 percentage points higher than we
expected in March, as real GDP growth is expected to be higher. Thereafter real GDP per
person growth is 0.3 per cent slower a year than in our March forecast, reflecting lower
productivity growth. By the forecast horizon, we expect the level of real GDP per person to
be broadly in line with our March forecast.

Box 2.2: Blue Book 2025 revisions
The Blue Book is an annual ONS publication which updates the sources and methods used for
the UK National Accounts. The Quarterly National Accounts consistent with the Blue Book 2025
were published on 30 September, and we incorporated the implications of this data for the
starting level and composition of GDP into our forecast. The revisions indicate the economy is
larger than previously thought, and that the business sector has accounted for a greater share of
activity, while the household sector has accounted for a smaller share.
The Blue Book revisions raised the level of nominal GDP by 1.4 per cent in the second quarter of
2025 – the starting point of our forecast. Most of this revision is from before the pandemic, with
the level of nominal GDP in 2019 up by 0.9 per cent (Chart C, left panel). The higher level
therefore means little for current momentum in the economy and our forecast for GDP growth.
Cumulative nominal GDP growth between 2019 and 2024 was revised up 0.4 percentage
points, driven by upward revisions to growth between 2020 and 2022, partly offset by
downward revisions in 2023 and 2024 (Chart C, right panel). Cumulative real GDP growth
between 2019 and 2024 was revised up 0.5 percentage points, and cumulative growth in the

GDP deflator was revised down 0.2 percentage points. Higher real GDP growth was driven by
stronger investment and exports, partly offset by weaker consumption and higher imports.

2024

The revisions also change the composition of GDP at the start of our forecast, with the economy
driven less by household activity and more by business activity than previously thought (Chart D).
In the second quarter of 2025:
•

On the income side, labour income as a share of GDP was revised down 1.3 percentage
points, from 48.1 to 46.9 per cent. Meanwhile, the share of corporate profits was revised
up 0.9 percentage points, from 14.9 to 15.9 per cent. The share of other income in
nominal GDP (including employer social contributions, imputed rents and government
depreciation) was revised up 0.4 percentage points.

•

On the expenditure side, household consumption as a share of GDP was revised down
1.2 percentage points, from 61.9 to 60.7 per cent. Business investment’s share of GDP
was revised up 1.6 percentage points, from 8.5 to 10 per cent. The share of other
expenditure in nominal GDP (including government spending, inventories and net
exports) was revised down 0.3 percentage points.

Source: ONS, OBR

While the revisions to the starting level have not changed our view about the outlook for overall
GDP growth, the compositional changes have contributed to our forecast judgements. We now
expect a stronger recovery in the consumption share of GDP, and a shallower decline in the
labour share of income over the forecast, partly due to both starting from a lower point.
Conversely, we expect weaker profits growth, as the revisions imply firms have less need to
rebuild margins than previously thought (see paragraph 2.47). These judgements have affected
the outlook for tax bases, which affects the fiscal outlook (see paragraph 2.64).

Output gap
2.31

We judge there is currently a small amount of spare capacity in the economy (excess supply
relative to our estimate of potential output), broadly in line with our March forecast. Our
estimate for the output gap in the second quarter of 2025 is -0.5 per cent, marginally
narrower (less spare capacity) than we expected in March. We forecast the output gap to
stay at -0.5 per cent in 2026, before closing gradually through 2027 and 2028. Compared
to our March forecast, we expect the output gap to close more slowly amid continued
weakness across confidence surveys and higher medium-term interest rate expectations. We
expect policy measures announced since March to narrow the output gap by around 0.1
percentage points in 2026-27. Some loosening in monetary policy helps to close the output
gap by 2029 (see Chapter 3).

Inflation
2.32

From 2.5 per cent in 2024, our central forecast for CPI inflation rises to 3.5 per cent this
year, before falling to 2.5 per cent in 2026, 0.2 and 0.4 percentage points higher than we
projected in March, respectively. We expect quarterly inflation to have peaked at just under
4 per cent in the third quarter of 2025, driven mainly by higher services and food price
inflation. We forecast inflation to return to the Bank of England’s 2 per cent target in 2027,
a year later than forecast in March (Chart 2.12). Higher and more persistent inflation in this
forecast reflects stronger momentum in services price inflation and higher wage settlement
expectations for 2025 and 2026 outweighing a more persistent negative output gap.

2.33

Government policy measures announced since March are expected to decrease inflation by
0.3 percentage points in 2026 (a peak quarterly impact of 0.5 percentage points in the
second quarter of 2026), primarily reflecting the impact of measures that reduce household
energy bills and the fuel duty freeze extension (see Chapter 3).9 We then expect Government
policy to add 0.1 percentage points to CPI inflation in 2028, due to the new VED charge on
electric vehicles in April 2028.

2.34

Risks around the inflation outlook remain elevated, both due to domestic and international
factors. Domestically, there is uncertainty about how far wage growth will moderate in the
coming year, as well as the risk that higher inflation expectations will keep inflation higher
for longer. Internationally, ongoing geopolitical developments could lead to further volatility
in energy prices, and changes in global trade policy could significantly affect import prices.
Purely based on past forecast errors, there is a one-in-five chance that CPI inflation in 2026
will be above 3.7 per cent and a similar chance that it will be below 1.4 per cent.

9

The fuel duty freeze extension that we incorporated into our economy forecast is slightly different to the final policy decision. The
Government informed us of the final policy after the deadline for including it in the final economy forecast. Incorporating the final policy
would have had less than a 0.1 percentage point impact on our inflation forecast.

2.35

We expect RPI inflation of 4.3 per cent in 2025 and 3.7 per cent in 2026, falling to average
3.0 per cent a year from 2027 to 2029. We then expect RPI to drop to 2.3 per cent in 2030
as the ONS converges RPI growth to equal CPIH growth (see Box 2.3 of our October 2024
EFO). Alongside changes to CPI inflation, we expect a slightly higher RPI-CPI wedge than in
March in 2026 and 2027 due to higher mortgage interest payments, which only affect RPI.

2.36

The GDP deflator, measuring the price of all domestically produced goods and services, is
projected to grow largely in line with CPI throughout the forecast. We expect GDP deflator
growth of 3.4 per cent in 2025, slowing to 2.3 per cent in 2026. From 2027, GDP deflator
growth averages 1.9 per cent a year, broadly in line with CPI inflation. Compared to March,
we project cumulative growth in the GDP deflator from 2025-26 to 2029-30 to be 0.5
percentage points higher, due to more persistent domestically generated inflation.

Labour market
2.37

10

Recent data point to a continued loosening in labour market conditions, with the
unemployment rate rising and a further, but easing pace of, decline in vacancies. The
increase in employer NICs and weak business sentiment appear to be weighing on labour
demand. Despite these factors, both nominal and real wage growth are higher than we
anticipated in March, though there are signs of easing in the most recent data. The quality
of LFS data has improved as response rates have partly recovered and the level of the latest
employment estimates appears to be more coherent with other indicators. However, we
judge that the LFS likely overstates recent growth in participation and employment, noting
the ONS’s caution that both ‘real’ changes and operational improvements to the LFS have
affected recent growth estimates.10 Hence we continue to draw on a wide range of evidence,

Unemployment and employment
2.38

We expect the unemployment rate to stay close to its current level of around 5 per cent in
the coming quarters, then fall gradually to its estimated equilibrium rate of 4.1 per cent
from 2027 as the negative output gap closes (Chart 2.14, left panel). The unemployment
rate has been steadily trending upward since the post-pandemic trough of 3.8 per cent in
2022, reaching 5.0 per cent in the third quarter of 2025.11 This appears to be driven by
entrants into the labour force struggling to find work amid subdued demand for hiring, with
indicators such as the KPMG and REC UK Report on Jobs and the employment component
of the UK PMI signalling ongoing weakness in labour demand. The rate of job losses has
only picked up modestly, consistent with the claimant count and redundancies both holding
broadly stable over the last year. Compared to March, we expect a 0.6 percentage points
higher unemployment rate in 2026 (around 240,000 people), as it returns to its equilibrium
rate more slowly. This is in line with an output gap that stays negative for longer.

2.39

The employment rate is expected to be broadly flat at around 60.7 per cent over the
forecast period. A cyclical fall in the unemployment rate is offset by a structural fall in the
participation rate. Compared to the March forecast, we expect the employment rate to be
0.4 percentage points higher on average across the forecast, mainly due to a 0.4
percentage point higher starting point (Chart 2.14, right panel). This reflects the increasing
convergence between the LFS and other employment measures.

11

The publication of the unemployment rate for the third quarter of 2025 was after we finalised our pre-measures forecast and was 0.1
percentage points higher than expected. Incorporating this outturn would not have materially changed our central forecast.

Average earnings
2.40

We estimate nominal weekly earnings growth will hold at around 5 per cent in 2025, before
falling to 31/3 per cent in 2026. These are both around 1 percentage point higher than we
expected in March. The 2025 change reflects upward revisions to earnings growth at the
end of 2024 and slightly stronger-than-expected growth at the start of 2025. The revision in
2026 reflects unanticipated strength in recent data. Both average weekly earnings and
measures of real-time indicators report annual earnings growth around 5 per cent in the
third quarter of 2025. And surveys of wage settlement expectations have stayed higher than
we expected, pointing to pay growth ranging from around 3 to 3½ per cent in 2026.

2.41

Real weekly earnings growth is estimated to have slowed from around 21/3 per cent in 2024
to about 12/3 per cent in 2025, with the latter only around 2/3 percentage points higher than
March as inflation has also proved more persistent than we expected. We expect earnings
growth to ease further in 2026 to around 2/3 per cent as the labour market loosens, though
this is around 2/3 per cent higher than March as wage settlement expectations have held up
despite weak productivity growth and the prospect of slower inflation ahead.

2.42

We then expect nominal weekly earnings growth to fall back to around 2¼ per cent over the
remaining years of the forecast. This is due to a continued loosening in labour market
conditions, lower inflation, and gradual pass-through of more of the recent rise in employer
NICs lowering wages after firms initially absorbed a significant proportion in margins.
Nominal earnings growth between 2027 and 2029 is similar to our March EFO, as our
downgrade to our productivity growth forecast is broadly offset by less need for firms to
rebuild their profit margins by keeping real earnings growth below productivity growth.

2.43

Nominal hourly earnings growth, which adjusts for a demographically driven fall in average
weekly hours worked and better reflects individuals’ pay rises, is forecast at around 2½ per

41

Economic outlook

cent a year in the medium term (Chart 2.15, left panel).12 Real hourly earnings growth is
expected to average about ½ a per cent a year over the medium term, growing more slowly
than productivity, as firms look to rebuild their squeezed rate of return on capital (see
paragraph 2.47).

Composition of economic activity
Households
Household disposable income
2.44

The starting level of real household disposable income (RHDI) per person has been revised
down relative to our March forecast by £150 (in 2023 prices) to £26,300 in 2024-25 (Chart
2.16, left panel). But RHDI per person is projected to grow more slowly over the forecast
than in March. Growth slows sharply in our central forecast from 3 per cent in 2024-25 to
½ a per cent in 2025-26 and ¼ per cent in 2026-27. It then averages ¼ per cent a year in
the rest of the forecast – well below the last decade’s average of just under 1 per cent a
year. This reflects our expectations of gradually slowing real wage growth and rising taxes
(Chart 2.16, right side). Compared to March, growth averages ¼ percentage points a year
less across the forecast, partly due to higher personal taxes including the extension to the
freeze in personal tax thresholds beyond 2027-28 (see Chapter 3 for more details).

12

The effects of personal tax rises announced in this Budget on wages and profits are captured via the costings (see Chapter 3). The
effects are not material for the economy forecast as they are largely offsetting for wages and have only a small negative effect on profits.

Household saving
2.45

From a trough of ½ a per cent in 2022, we expect the household saving rate, adjusted for
pension equity, to peak at 6½ per cent in 2025 before falling to 2¼ per cent in 2030.
Compared to March, the saving rate has been revised up ½ a per cent in 2024 and slightly
exceeded our forecast in the first half of 2025. However, by the start of 2030, we expect the
saving rate to be ½ a percentage point lower than in March, as households try to maintain
consumption growth despite slow disposable income growth.

Household consumption
2.46

Despite resilient real income growth in the face of economic shocks, real consumption fell
by an average of ¼ per cent a year in 2023 and 2024 as the saving rate rose. Our central
forecast is for consumption growth to average 1 per cent a year in 2025 and 2026, before
recovering further to around 1¾ per cent by 2029 as the saving rate falls. Consumption
growth across the forecast averages ¼ percentage points a year less than in March, with
measures at this Budget that cut disposable income accounting for around half the change
(see paragraph 3.16). Consumption is now a smaller share of GDP than in March, due to a
sizeable downward revision to its starting level in the Blue Book 2025 (see Box 2.2).
However, we expect this share to rise across the forecast, from 60 ¾ per cent of nominal
GDP in 2025 to around 61¼ per cent by 2029. While this end-point is still 1 percentage
point lower than in March, the gently rising consumption share helps the fiscal position, as
consumer spending has a relatively high effective tax rate (see paragraph 2.65).

Business profits and investment
2.47

After falling from around 12½ per cent in 2022 to 10¾ per cent in 2025, we expect the
real rate of return on business capital to partly recover to around 11 per cent by end-2030
(Chart 2.18, left panel). Our measure of the rate of return has trended down in recent
years, as real wage growth has outstripped productivity growth. And we expect this trend to
continue into 2026 based on surveys showing wage settlement expectations remaining
strong. In the medium term, we expect that firms will attempt to rebuild their rates of return
by keeping wage growth below productivity growth. But ONS revisions suggest the rate of
return on capital has fallen by less than previously thought, moderating the need to rebuild
it as rapidly over coming years compared to our judgement in March.

2.48

We have therefore revised down our forecast for profits growth across the forecast. We
expect profits as a share of GDP to fall from around 17 per cent before the pandemic to
15¾ per cent in 2025 and 2026, before recovering marginally to 16 per cent by 2030.
While profits grow more slowly over the forecast than in March, a higher starting point in
ONS outturn means the profit share remains ¾ percentage points of GDP above its March
level by 2029.

2.49

A relatively high cost of capital and a weak rate of return together generate a modest
decline in investment as a share of GDP over the forecast from 10¾ per cent in 2025 to just
under 10½ per cent in 2030. The ONS has revised up business investment significantly in
outturn data, suggesting investment rebounded more quickly from the pandemic than we
thought (see Box 2.2). However, the cost of capital has risen over recent years, reflecting
higher long-term interest rates, and the real return on capital is at a historically low level.
Investment intentions and business confidence also remain subdued. As a result, we expect
sluggish real business investment growth, averaging ¾ per cent a year between 2026 and
2030. This is weaker than in March, consistent with our lower profits growth forecast.

Government
2.50

Real government spending, the sum of consumption and investment, grows by 1.7 per cent
on average between 2026 and 2030. This is broadly flat as a share of GDP, similar to our
March forecast. Average annual growth in real government consumption is 1.6 per cent
and in real government investment is 2.4 per cent. Its drivers and composition are discussed
in more detail in Chapter 5.

Trade and the current account
2.51

Our March forecast was published around a week before the 2 April Rose Garden
Announcement, which raised average effective US tariff rates to 24.6 per cent, a level last
seen over 100 years ago. Since then, the US has lowered tariff rates somewhat to 18.8 per
cent,13 though they remain elevated compared to the past 75 years, and close to the
universal 20 percentage point rise in tariffs on US trading partners assumed in Scenario 2 in
Box 2.2 of our March 2025 EFO. As a result, the weighted average of statutory tariffs levied
by the US on the UK has risen by around 8 percentage points since the end of 2024 to 9.3
per cent.14 This is a significant increase in tariffs faced by UK exporters to the US, though
lower than the increase faced by many other US trading partners of 16.1 percentage points
on average. There is still significant uncertainty about the future direction of US and global
trade policy, with threats of higher tariffs on many trading partners.

2.52

UK exports grew 0.7 per cent in 2024 and we expect growth to reach 3.3 per cent in 2025
before averaging 0.6 per cent a year between 2026 and 2030. Imports grew 2.6 per cent
in 2024 and we expect growth to reach 3.7 per cent in 2025 before slowing to average 1
per cent a year over the rest of the forecast. Strong trade growth in 2025 mainly reflects
activity brought forward in anticipation of tariff increases. Weak growth over the medium
term reflects a more restrictive global trade environment as well as the ongoing impact of
Brexit, which we continue to expect to reduce the overall trade intensity of the UK economy
by 15 per cent in the long term.15 The impact of a more restrictive trade environment on
productivity growth is discussed in Annex C of Briefing paper No. 9: Forecasting productivity.

13

The latest tariff rates in this paragraph are from the IMF's October 2025 WEO.
While the UK and US have outlined terms of negotiation and implemented some changes to the trading regime in the General terms for
the United States of America and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland Economic Prosperity Deal, the details of the
future trading arrangement are yet to be negotiated and confirmed.

2.53

New trade deals have the potential to increase UK trade and GDP. These include the freetrade agreement between the UK and India, and the Common Understanding between the
UK and EU setting out commitments to bilateral cooperation across a range of policy areas,
including establishing a common sanitary and phytosanitary area and an agreement to link
the UK and EU emission trading schemes. Where these meet our refined criteria for making
a supply-side adjustment (see Box 3.1), we will incorporate their effects into our forecasts.

2.54

We expect the current account deficit to widen from 2.2 per cent of GDP in 2024 to average
3½ per cent from 2025 onwards. This reflects a slight widening of the trade deficit, as
imports grow faster than exports, from 0.9 per cent of GDP in 2024 to 1.2 per cent by
2030. As global short-term interest rates fall faster than UK rates, the investment income
deficit also widens, from 0.7 per cent of GDP in 2024 to 2 per cent in 2030.

Sectoral net lending
2.55

Interest rate rises and precautionary saving have pushed up the household sector surplus in
recent years, and we expect it to be around 3½ per cent of GDP in 2025 (Chart 2.21). But
we forecast household net lending to fall back to close to zero by the end of the decade.
This is driven by falls in short-term interest rates and lower precautionary saving, alongside
a rise in residential investment due to the planning reforms incorporated into the March
forecast. The public deficit is forecast to narrow, mainly through a rising tax take as a share
of GDP, though we expect a near-term rise in government investment as a share of GDP.

2.56

A squeeze on corporate profit margins, alongside a rise in business investment as a share of
GDP, has pushed the corporate sector into deficit this year. We expect this deficit to widen to
2½ per cent of GDP by the end of 2027, before narrowing in the medium term as firms
rebuild profit margins and business investment falls slightly as a share of GDP. Continued
current account deficits (higher imports than exports) mean the external sector remains in
surplus. This picture is broadly similar to our March forecast. Policy measures in this Budget
47

Economic and fiscal outlook

Economic outlook

increase the public deficit by around ¼ per cent of GDP in 2026 and 2027, and decrease it
by around ½ a per cent of GDP in 2029 and 2030, which is largely absorbed by household
and corporate net lending.

The housing market
Mortgage rates
2.57

Average interest rates on the stock of mortgages are expected to rise from around 3.7 per
cent in 2024 to around 5 per cent in 2029, 0.2 percentage points higher than our March
forecast. The high proportion of fixed-rate mortgages (around 90 per cent) means past
increases in Bank Rate feed through slowly to the stock of mortgages.

Housing supply
2.58

Net additions to the UK housing stock are expected to fall from an average of 260,000 a
year in the early 2020s to a low of 215,000 in 2026-27, as recent subdued housing starts
are reflected in additions. We then expect net additions to rise sharply to 305,000 in 202930, reflecting the impact of planning reforms. Compared to March, net additions are
10,000 lower in 2024-25 but around 25,000 higher in 2025-26, based on estimates
drawn from new domestic Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs) up to early October. We
expect slightly lower net additions toward the end of the forecast due to slightly higher
forecast mortgage rates from 2028 onwards. This leaves cumulative net additions between
2024-25 and 2029-30 at 1.49 million, around 10,000 lower than in March.

House prices and property transactions
2.59

The average house price in the UK is expected to rise over the forecast from £260,000 in
2024, to just under £305,000 in 2030. In our forecast, house prices grow just under 3 per
cent in 2025 and average 2½ per cent annual growth from 2026, broadly in line with
average nominal earnings growth. We expect the increase to property income tax rates from
April 2027 to reduce house price growth by around 0.1 percentage points a year from
2028 (see Chapter 3).

2.60

Residential housing transactions have been volatile this year, rising sharply in the first
quarter and then falling sharply in the second, as transactions were brought forward to take
advantage of the stamp duty holiday ending in April. We expect property transactions to
increase over the forecast, from just under 1.1 million in 2024 to around 1.3 million in
2029. This is around 155,000 fewer transactions a year than in our March forecast by 2029
(Chart 2.23). Our lower forecast for property transactions over the medium term is because
we have lowered our assumed turnover rate (the ratio of the total housing stock to housing
transactions) to better reflect the impact of past increases in average stamp duty. The
projected increase in mortgage rates in our forecast and an ageing population that
transacts property both later in life and less frequently, also weigh on transactions.16

Residential investment
2.61

We expect residential investment growth to accelerate from 1 per cent in 2025 to around 7
per cent in 2027 and 2028, as monetary policy loosens and planning reforms take effect.17
Growth moderates to 2 per cent by 2030 as these effects fade. Relative to March, residential
investment growth is 3 percentage points higher in 2025, due to stronger outturn, but is 1.3
percentage points lower on average from 2026 to 2029, reflecting the rise in medium-term
interest rate expectations and a lower housing market turnover rate, described above.

Nominal GDP and its composition
2.62

In our central forecast, nominal GDP growth is 4.3 per cent in 2025-26, then averages 3½
per cent a year in the rest of the forecast. Cumulative nominal GDP growth between 202526 and 2029-30 is 0.9 percentage points lower than in March, with 1.3 percentage points
lower real GDP growth partly offset by 0.5 percentage points higher GDP deflator growth.
Policy measures at this Budget reduce nominal GDP growth 0.1 percentage points in both
2027-28 and 2028-29.

2.63

In addition to the total amount of nominal GDP growth over the forecast, its composition
also matters for our fiscal forecast, as different kinds of income and expenditure have
different effective tax rates. While cumulative nominal GDP growth is lower than in the
March forecast, its composition is more fiscally favourable (as discussed in Box 4.1).

2.64

On the income side, we have increased growth in the tax base with the highest effective tax
rate and reduced growth in tax bases with lower effective tax rates (Chart 2.24, left panel):

17

Residential investment includes new housing supply, housing improvements and ‘transfer costs’ related to transactions.

•

Despite the downward revision to nominal GDP growth, we have revised up cumulative
growth in nominal labour income around 1 percentage point, while we have revised
down cumulative growth in profits by significantly more than the revision to nominal
GDP (around 6 percentage points). This is because surveys of wage expectations
suggest that near-term real wage growth will be stronger than we expected in March,
but we have revised down our productivity growth forecast. And revisions suggest a
stronger starting point for firms’ rate of return, reducing their need to keep real wage
growth below productivity growth in the medium term to rebuild profit margins.

•

Labour income makes up the largest share of income (47 per cent in 2025-26) and is
now expected to grow faster over the forecast. As a result, it has contributed 0.2
percentage points to our nominal GDP revision. It also has a high effective average tax
rate of around 40 per cent. Corporate profits only make up 16 per cent of GDP so
have contributed -0.7 percentage points to the nominal GDP revision. Profits have a
lower effective tax rate of around 17 per cent. Other parts of income (making up 37
per cent of GDP), have contributed -0.4 percentage points to the downward revision
and these mostly have an effective tax rate close to zero.

On the expenditure side (Chart 2.24, right panel):
•

We have lowered cumulative growth in nominal consumption, the spending
component with the highest effective tax rate at 10 per cent, by less than the revision to
nominal GDP. This is because the upward revision to labour income is only partly
offset by increases in personal taxes in this Budget.

•

We have revised down cumulative nominal corporate investment growth, which has a
negative short-term effective tax rate of -10 per cent due to investment allowances, by
more than nominal GDP. This reflects the increase in long-term interest rates raising
the real cost of capital and is consistent with downward revisions to profits growth.

Comparison with external forecasters
2.66

Our central forecast for real GDP growth is slightly above the average of external forecasts
but slightly below the Bank of England’s November forecast. Our 2026 forecast is slightly
above both the external average and Bank of England which will be partly explained by our
estimate that the impact of Budget policy measures will increase real GDP growth by 0.1
percentage points next year. Our real GDP growth forecast is then above the average of
external forecasts by an average of 0.1 percentage points between 2027 and 2029 (Chart
2.25, left panel). This means our forecast for cumulative growth in real GDP between 2024
and 2029 is 7.6 per cent, 0.6 percentage points higher than the average of externals which
will likely reflect us having a slightly higher forecast for potential output growth (Chart 2.25,
right panel). However, our forecast for cumulative growth by 2029 is within the swathe of
external forecasts. And our forecast for cumulative growth between 2024 and 2028 is 0.3
percentage points lower than the Bank’s. With identical assumptions between ourselves and
the Bank for the starting and ending output gaps, this small difference reflects slightly
differing views on cumulative potential output growth.

Our CPI inflation forecast is broadly in line with the Bank of England and external
forecasters – except in 2026, where policy measures announced in this Budget (which are
likely not incorporated into external forecasts) reduce CPI inflation by 0.3 percentage points.
Our forecast for the unemployment rate is broadly in line with figures from both the Bank of
England and external forecasters in 2025 and 2026, but is lower thereafter, reflecting
different assumptions about its equilibrium rate or the output gap.

Introduction
3.1

3.2

This chapter:
•

sets out the total effect of Government decisions taken in this Budget and in the period
since Spring Statement 2025, on public sector net borrowing and the public sector
balance sheet;

•

describes the impact of these policy decisions on our economy forecast;

•

describes the fiscal effects of the major policy measures including how they have been
incorporated in our forecast and the uncertainties around them;

•

provides an update on selected previous measures;

•

discusses policy risks, including possible measures that are not currently included in
our central forecast; and

•

analyses the long-term impacts of government policy decisions.

In the run-up to any fiscal event, the Government provides us with draft estimates of the
fiscal cost or gain of each policy measure it is considering, which then undergo an iterative
scrutiny process. After this process is complete, the Government chooses which measures to
announce and which costings to include in its policy decisions table. For these costings we
choose whether to certify them as ‘reasonable and central’, and whether to include them –
or alternative costings of our own – in our forecast. We have certified all but three measures
in this forecast. Relatively small changes were made to the policy parameters of the student
loan thresholds freeze, part-funding the renewables obligation, and the fuel duty freeze
measures following the costings certification deadline. As a result, we were not able to
certify the final version of these costings, but have used the Government’s estimates in this
forecast and will finalise the certification process for our next forecast. We do not expect this
will have a material impact on the costings we have used.

The impact of fiscal policy decisions on borrowing
3.3

This forecast incorporates the economic and fiscal implications of policy measures
announced in this Budget and since Spring Statement 2025. Overall, the direct effect of
these measures increases borrowing by £3.7 billion in 2025-26, by £5.9 billion in 2026-27

55

Economic and fiscal outlook

Policy measures

and by £9.9 billion in 2027-28. The direct effect of policy measures reduces borrowing
thereafter by amounts increasing to £14.8 billion in 2029-30 and £18.0 billion in 2030-31.
3.4

3.5

The near-term increase in borrowing is primarily driven by policies which increase public
spending across the forecast period, costing a total of £6.6 billion in 2026-27 and £11.3
billion in 2029-30:
•

Welfare measures increase spending by £4.7 billion in 2026-27, rising to £9.3 billion
in 2029-30. These include the reversals to previously announced cuts to winter fuel
payments and health-related benefits announced in the summer, which increase
spending by £6.9 billion in 2029-30, and the removal of the two-child limit within
universal credit (UC), which increases spending by £3.0 billion by 2029-30.

•

Other spending measures increase borrowing by £1.8 billion in 2026-27 and £9.8
billion in 2027-28, falling to £2.0 billion in 2029-30. These include temporarily
reducing energy bills by part-funding the renewables obligation, and increases to
departmental resource and capital spending over the 2025 Spending Review period.

Over the medium term, the cost of these measures is more than offset by a wide-ranging set
of changes to tax policy which raise receipts and lower borrowing by £0.7 billion in 202627 rising to £26.1 billion by 2029-30. As a share of GDP, the policies in this Budget deliver
the third-largest medium-term tax increase since the OBR was established in 2010, after the
March 2021 and the October 2024 Budgets. Tax policies comprise:
•

•

A set of personal tax changes which increase receipts by £14.9 billion in 2029-30,
including:
•

freezing personal tax and employer National Insurance contributions (NICs)
thresholds for three years from 2028-29, which raises £8.0 billion;

•

charging NICs on salary-sacrificed pensions contributions, raising £4.7
billion; and

•

increasing the tax rates on dividends, property and savings income by 2
percentage points, raising £2.1 billion.

Other tax changes increase receipts by £11.2 billion in 2029-30. These include:
•

a reduction to the writing down allowance main rate in corporation tax,
which raises £1.5 billion;

•

a new mileage-based charge on battery electric and plug-in hybrid cars from
April 2028, raising £1.4 billion;

•

reforms to the taxation of gambling, which raises £1.1 billion;

Policy measures

•

reduced capital gains tax relief on disposals to employee ownership trusts,
which raises £0.9 billion;

•

a high value council tax surcharge on properties worth over £2 million,
raising £0.4 billion;

•

tax administration, compliance and debt collection measures, which raise
£2.3 billion;

•

these tax rises are partially offset by a freeze to fuel duty for a further five
months followed by staged increases from September 2026, costing £2.4
billion next year and £0.9 billion each year thereafter; and

•

a range of other tax measures, including the introduction of the Sizewell C
regulated asset base (RAB) levy, collectively raise a further £4.4 billion.

3.6

In addition to the direct fiscal effects of measures, Table 3.1 also includes their indirect
effects on the public finances via the economy. The impacts of Budget policies on the
economy are estimated to reduce borrowing by £2.0 billion in 2026-27 largely due to lower
inflation. The indirect effects of policies then raise borrowing by amounts rising to £5.2
billion in 2029-30 due to the personal tax rises weighing on consumption and lower
inflation reducing nominal earnings, which both reduce receipts. Higher near-term
borrowing also raises debt interest spending.

3.7

Table 3.1 also shows the estimated knock-on effects on spending of the Government’s
decision at this Budget to fund the full cost of special educational needs and disabilities
(SEND) provision from within departmental spending from 2028-29. Due to this we have
reduced our assumption for departmental underspending in 2028-29 to zero and reduced
total local authority spending from that year through to 2030-31 by £2.6 billion on
average. These SEND-related spending judgements reduce borrowing by £1.9 billion on
average across the final three years of the forecast.

3.8

The total direct effects of policy decisions on borrowing presented in Table 3.1 is £3.4
billion higher in 2026-27 and £5.8 billion lower in 2029-30 than the total presented in the
Treasury’s policy decisions table. The total for the direct effects of taxation policy is the same
as included on the Treasury’s policy decisions table.1 The difference reflects a number of
changes related to public spending which the Treasury has not included in its presentation
of policy decisions. Specifically, our presentation of policy includes OBR judgements on the
degree of underspending by departments in response to Treasury policy changes, changes
the Treasury has made to its assumption on departmental underspending outside of
Spending Review years, Treasury updates to spending plans at Mains estimates, and
Treasury switches between fiscal and non-fiscal departmental spending. These changes are
not reflected in the Treasury’s policy table. We present these changes individually in our
supplementary scorecard available on the website.

1

Some measures affect both tax and spending. The Treasury’s treatment of these measures apportions the entire impact of the measure
to either tax or spending, whereas our treatment separates out the elements affecting our receipts and spending forecasts.

Across the five years of the forecast, the Budget delivers a relatively small net reduction in
borrowing of 0.04 per cent of GDP (£2.0 billion) on average per year. This represents the
second consecutive fiscal event involving a small overall policy tightening following four
successive events of policy loosening prior to that (Chart 3.1).

3.10

The fact that the average overall tightening is just £2.0 billion (0.04 per cent of GDP) is the
result of a relatively large policy loosening this year and over the next two years (on average
£7.5 billion or 0.2 per cent of GDP over the next two years), which is offset by a relatively
large tightening in the last two years of the forecast (on average of £12.8 billion or 0.4 per
cent of GDP). As Chart 3.2 shows, it is usually the case that contractionary fiscal policy
packages are backloaded, with more tightening in the later years of the forecast. At this
event, the policy package has a larger-than-average rise in borrowing in the near term,
followed by a more typical reduction in borrowing in the medium term.

Economic effects of policy measures
3.11

Our economy forecast accounts for the economic impacts of announced government policy.
The demand-side effects of fiscal policy are informed by ‘multipliers’ which are drawn from
empirical literature and reviewed periodically.2 These capture the impacts of measures on
demand through changes to private incomes and expenditure. We typically assume these
effects taper to zero by the end of the forecast as the exchange rate and real wages adjust,
and the Bank of England adjusts monetary policy to bring the output back in line with its
potential level.

3.12

The impact of policies on the supply side of the economy is also accounted for if credible
evidence suggests that measures will have a significant, additional, and durable impact on
potential output. In response to our recent external review,3 we have reviewed our approach
to accounting for the supply-side effects of policies and published our conclusions alongside
this Economic and fiscal outlook (EFO). These are summarised in Box 3.1 and include
clarifying the definition of a ‘significant’ measure, or package of measures, to be one which
is estimated to change the level of potential output by at least 0.1 per cent by the fifth year
of our forecast. This and the other recommendations of the review have been applied to the
policy measures announced in this Budget.

Economic and fiscal outlook

Policy measures

Box 3.1: Accounting for the supply-side effects of policy measures
Since the March 2023 Economic and fiscal outlook (EFO), enhancements to our forecasts of the
drivers of potential output and additional resources have enabled the OBR to more explicitly
reflect the supply-side impacts of policy measures in our medium-term forecasts. In response to a
recommendation from our recent external review,a we have reviewed our approach to
accounting for these supply-side impacts and published our conclusions alongside this EFO (see
Briefing Paper No. 10: Accounting for the supply-side effects of policy).
The paper highlights that, in the five EFOs from March 2023 to March 2025, we judged that 19
tax, spending, and regulatory policies met our supply-side criteria of: significance, additionality,
durability, and evidence base (Chart A).b Their impacts were therefore incorporated into our
potential output forecast. In net terms, these 19 policy measures had an average impact on the
level of potential output in the fifth year of our forecast of 0.04 per cent, and a cumulative
impact of 0.7 per cent.c However, there is considerable variation in the impact of individual
policies. Impacts range from -0.25 per cent for the freezing of personal tax thresholds in the
March 2024 EFO, to +0.2 per cent for the planning reforms in the March 2025 EFO.
Based on the review, we are making the following changes to our approach:
•

Defining significance: We have clarified the definition of a ‘significant’ supply-side impact
to mean that a policy, or package of measures, should be estimated to increase or
decrease potential output by at least 0.1 per cent by the fifth year of the forecast (dotted
lines on Chart A). Under this definition, the cumulative net impact of all six significant
polices between March 2023 and March 2025 on the level of potential output after five
years in our forecasts would have been 0.6 per cent.

•

Tracking implementation and impact: For all policies whose supply-side effects are
explicitly captured in our forecast, government departments should submit a draft
monitoring and evaluation plan to the OBR at the relevant fiscal event. Plans will then be
published within six months. Evaluations, as the default, will need to be concluded and
published within five years of the initial scoring, with interim reports in all cases.d

•

Ensuring additionality: The net impact of a policy must be additional to the effects of
similar previous and existing policy programmes, after accounting for wider policy
changes which may have offsetting economic effects. This is relatively straightforward for
tax and welfare spending policies, as our forecasts include explicit assumptions about the
counterfactual ‘pre-measures’ rates, allowances, and thresholds. It is more challenging
for policies affecting departmental spending, which we generally forecast top down, and
regulation, where there is no baseline forecast for the overall regulatory burden on the
economy. There is therefore a heightened risk that the supply-side impact of an individual
policy may be partially or fully offset by other policy changes. As such, for such policies to
be judged as additional there must be a well-defined policy baseline against which the
impact of the new policy can be assessed, a clearly specified funding and resource plan
for the new policy, and clear evidence that the impact of the new policy will not be offset
by other spending or regulatory changes.

61

Economic and fiscal outlook

Policy measures

•

Developing the evidence base: There should be clear empirical and analytical support for
the impact of a policy on potential output in the UK or similar countries. Where a policy
has not been attempted before in the UK, its supply-side impact should be capable of
quantification based on plausible mechanisms which have been empirically
demonstrated in comparable contexts. The OBR will be publishing its first set of areas of
research interest in the coming months, which will include areas where we have identified
gaps in the literature regarding the impact of government policies on the determinants of
potential output.

c
In absolute terms, the 19 policies for which we made an explicit supply-side adjustment had an average impact on the level of
potential output in the fifth year of our forecast of 0.07 per cent.
d
For policies where the effect is likely to take time to materialise and for data covering that effect to be available, the evaluation may
require more time to meet Magenta Book standards. These cases will be agreed between the Government and the OBR as part of the
monitoring and evaluation plan. Here, two interim reports will be published within five years of the initial scoring, with the timing of
both the interim and final reports agreed between OBR, the Treasury and the lead department. We will work with government
departments in advance of the next fiscal event to implement this.
b

3.13

Following the application of our clarified significance criteria (see Box 3.1), we have
assessed that none of the policy measures in this Budget have a sufficiently material impact
to justify adjusting our post-measures potential output forecast.

3.14

However, our analysis suggests some policy measures could have impacts on potential
output that are close to the significance threshold. We estimate the combined effect of the
personal tax measures in this Budget could lower potential output by slightly less than 0.1
per cent in 2030-31, as lower financial incentives reduce labour supply. On the upside, the
ratification of the India free trade agreement could also increase potential output by more
than 0.1 per cent in the long term (see paragraph 3.77).

Economic and fiscal outlook

62

Policy measures

3.15

The temporary aggregate demand impacts of policies are informed by the application of
our fiscal multipliers. We judge that the initial fiscal loosening has a small, temporary,
positive impact on real GDP which peaks at 0.1 per cent in 2026-27, before diminishing
with the tapering of our multipliers and tightening of fiscal policy by the end of the forecast
period. We adjusted the standard application of our fiscal multipliers in this forecast. We
have excluded the impact of welfare policies that were reversed after Spring Statement 2025
in June and July, as they were already affecting outturn data and surveys of expectations
that were used in our pre-measures forecast. We have also lowered our fiscal multipliers as
we assume that forward-looking households and firms save some of extra after-tax income
from the near-term fiscal loosening, in anticipation of the future fiscal tightening. This lowers
the real GDP effect slightly in the near term and raises it slightly later in the forecast.

3.16

We have also adjusted the expenditure composition of GDP for the effect of Budget policies
(Chart 3.3).4 Real household disposable income (RHDI) is lowered in medium term by the
rise in personal tax rises announced in this Budget, which decreases household consumption
significantly (blue bars). Policy measures also increase government consumption and
investment slightly (green bars). This would result in a negative output gap so, as usual, we
assume monetary policy, the exchange rate, and real wages would adjust to bring output
back in line with potential. This disincentivises saving, and offsets some of the impact of
lower RHDI on consumption. It also drives a small rise in residential and business investment
(yellow bars), and net trade and other components (purple bars). The impacts on
government and business investment are too small to impact potential output.

In addition to the changes to our economy forecast, some individual policy measures are judged to have economic effects which are
reflected in the behavioural adjustments included in the estimates of the direct fiscal cost of measures that are shown in Table 3.1. This
includes the impact on property prices of the high value council tax surcharge and changes to the taxation of property income, and the
impact on profits, prices and nominal wages of the personal tax measures (freezes to personal tax thresholds, and NICs on salarysacrificed pensions contributions). These effects are not material for the economy forecast.

63

Economic and fiscal outlook

3.17

Budget policies reduce CPI inflation by 0.4 percentage points in 2026-27, reflecting the
measures affecting energy bills,5 the temporary extension of the fuel duty freeze, and the
one-year freeze to rail fares (Chart 3.4).6 At its peak, we estimate that the announced
policies will reduce CPI by 0.5 percentage points in the second quarter of 2026. CPI
inflation is then 0.1 percentage points higher in 2027-28, as the fuel duty freeze ends and
uprating by RPI resumes, and 0.1 percentage point higher in 2028-29, owing to the
introduction of the mileage-based charge on electric cars. The indirect effects of the fiscal
package through changes to the output gap are relatively small and do not change the
price level by the end of the forecast.

Spending measures announced in this Budget
Reversals and changes to previously announced welfare measures
3.18

Since Spring Statement 2025, the Government has announced several reversals or changes
to its previously announced welfare spending policies. In total, these changes are expected
to increase spending in every year and by £6.9 billion in 2029-30.7 They comprise:
•

The reintroduction in June of winter fuel payments (WFPs) to pensioners in England
and Wales, apart from those with taxable income over £35,000, which costs £1.6
billion this year and £1.7 billion in 2029-30. This largely reverses the July 2024 policy

5

This includes the exchequer temporarily part-funding the renewables obligation, the impact of the new supercharger uplift on household
bills from April 2027, the expansion of the warm home discount, and the ending of the energy company obligation from April 2026.
6
The fuel duty freeze extension that we incorporated into our economy forecast is slightly different to the final policy decision. The
Government informed us of the final policy after the deadline for including it in the final economy forecast. Incorporating the final policy
would have had less than a 0.1 percentage point impact on our inflation forecast.
7
As in Table 3.1, the figures in this paragraph include the consequences of decisions on the block grant adjustment. The figures for
individual measures that follow in the bullet points below do not, with the costings for the winter fuel payments and personal
independence payment measures on an England and Wales basis, and the costing for the universal credit health element measure on a
Great Britain basis.

to remove WFPs other than for those claiming pension credit. It results in around fourfifths of pensioners being eligible for WFPs. This cost is partially offset by tax recovered
from pensioners with taxable income over £35,000 who receive WFPs which then have
to be repaid, raising £0.5 billion in 2029-30.
•

The reversal in July of the Spring Statement 2025 policy to tighten the qualifying
criteria for the daily living component of personal independence payment, which was
due to affect claimants from November 2026, costing £3.9 billion in 2029-30.

•

Increases to the value of the universal credit health element (UCHE), also announced
in July, such that for existing claimants the combined value of the UC standard
allowance (UCSA) and UCHE rises in line with CPI inflation, at a cost of £520 million
by 2029-30. At Spring Statement 2025, the UCHE was frozen in cash terms for
claimants prior to April 2026. Despite above-inflation UCSA uprating, this meant that
the overall award from these two elements would have risen by less than inflation. The
new policy introduces below-inflation uprating to the UCHE to protect the combined
value of these two parts of the UC award in real terms.8

Box 3.2: The indirect effects of the Spring Statement 2025 welfare measures
In the March 2025 Economic and fiscal outlook, we were unable to assess the economic effects
of certain elements of the Pathways to Work Green Paper that had been incorporated into our
fiscal forecast, as the Government had not provided sufficient information at that time. We
committed to undertake a full assessment of these policies ahead of the current forecast. In
doing this, we have not applied our refined significance threshold (set out in Box 3.1) as these
policies were incorporated into our fiscal forecast before this change.
Our economy forecast now incorporates the net effect of the changes to universal credit (UC)
policies which remain in force following the policy changes made in July. We estimate these will
add around 15,000 average hours equivalent (AHE) to labour supply in 2029-30. This reflects
the net effect of:
•

the increase in the generosity of the UC standard allowance, which is expected to reduce
recipients’ financial incentive to enter or remain in employment, leading to an estimated
11,000 AHE reduction to labour supply; and

•

the reductions in the generosity of and eligibility for health-related benefits in UC, which
are expected to lower income for new claimants, increasing work incentives, and resulting
in an estimated 26,000 AHE increase in labour supply.

We have also assessed the new employment support programme announced in the Green
Paper. Based on evidence from similar past schemes, combined with the Department for Work
and Pensions’ range of estimates of the numbers of individuals that could be provided with
support, we estimate that the programme could support 20,000 to 40,000 inactive claimants

8

The UCHE below-inflation uprating is based on the USCA rate for single people aged 25 and over, so a separate small measure also
applies a further increase to the single, under 25 UCSA to ensure real-terms protection for this group too.

65

Economic and fiscal outlook

Policy measures

into work by 2029-30. The upside risks within this range include potential cost-saving
efficiencies, which could free up resource for the more effective elements of the scheme. The
downside risks relate to expected volumes of enrolment, which vary widely depending on
whether enrolment is mandatory or voluntary, and uncertainty around the level of engagement
from the target population.
However, over at least the past 10 years, successive governments have provided several similar
employment programmes, which will have supported the recent employment levels that provide
the baseline for our economy forecast. Our assessment of indicative levels of spending on
employment programmes over the forecast period, including both existing programmes and the
new spending funded at the Spring Statement, suggests that overall employment support
spending in the coming years will be broadly similar to its average level over the past ten years,
at around 0.1 per cent of GDP in real terms. We have therefore not adjusted our forecast to
account for the impact of the Spring Statement employment support policy, as it is not clear that
this new scheme meets the additionality criteria, described in Box 3.1, of materially increasing
the level of government employment support provision relative to the support provided by
previous schemes.

The Government has removed the two-child limit within UC from April 2026. The limit
restricted the UC child element, which is currently £3,500 per year for second and
subsequent children, to two children per family apart from children born prior to 6 April
2017 and those who meet certain exemption criteria. Its removal costs £2.3 billion in 202627 and £3.0 billion in 2029-30 (Table 3.2).9 This includes £300 million by 2029-30 for the
cost of an estimated 25,000 additional entitled families making a UC claim as a result of
the increase in benefit generosity.

3.20

In 2029-30, because of the policy, an estimated 560,000 families see an increase in UC
award averaging £5,310 per year. The Government estimates that this measure will reduce
child poverty by 450,000 by 2029-30, relative to the level had the two-child limit remained
in place.

9

The net cost of ‘other welfare measures’ in Table 3.1 also includes the fiscal impact of a number of smaller policies which in aggregate
reduce welfare spending, including various changes to the operation of assessments and reassessments for health-related benefits, which
save around £600 million in 2029-30.

Renewables obligation
3.21

The Government will temporarily refund electricity suppliers for 75 per cent of the domestic
portion of the renewables obligation (RO) scheme in 2026-27, 2027-28 and 2028-29.10
The estimated cost of this policy is £2.3 billion on average in these forecast years, before
falling to zero for the rest of the forecast. The RO scheme is a subsidy for renewable
electricity generation, paid for by electricity suppliers and currently fully passed onto
domestic and non-domestic electricity bills as a levy. Following the change, 25 per cent of
the cost will continue to be passed on to domestic electricity bills, rising to 100 per cent of
the cost from 2029-30 onwards. Non-domestic consumers are unaffected by this policy. See
Box 4.2 for more information on the RO scheme.

Student loans threshold freezes
3.22

The Government has announced a freeze to the repayments and interest rate thresholds for
Plan 2 student loan repayments for three years starting from 2027-28. These changes
increase cash receipts by £0.4 billion a year in the medium term, as a higher portion of
income is subject to repayment and a higher interest rate. These changes also result in a
one-off reduction in borrowing in 2026-27 of £5.6 billion related to reduced spending. This
reflects the increased value of the loan book due to greater repayments in future – under
accounting rules this is scored as a capital transfer from households to the government in
the year in which the legislation is enacted.

Changes to departmental expenditure
3.23

Policy announcements at this Budget and at the July 2025 Spending Review have increased
resource departmental spending in the near term, while reducing it in the final three years
of the forecast. For departmental capital spending, policy decisions increase spending

10

The Government has announced additional policy changes affecting energy bills, including a decision to not renew the energy company
obligation when the current four-year scheme expires in March 2026 and raising the relief offered to energy-intensive industries through
the network charging compensation scheme. These policies have no direct fiscal impact, but have inflation effects as described in
paragraph 3.17.

Policy measures

across the forecast period. Changes to departmental expenditure are discussed in more
detail in Chapter 5.
3.24

Day-to-day resource departmental spending (RDEL) has been increased over the 2025
Spending Review period by £1.5 billion in 2026-27 and £1.1 billion in 2027-28. This
reflects frontloaded funding for several additional spending commitments, notably an NHS
voluntary exit scheme, funding for the Department for Work and Pensions’ (DWP’s) ‘youth
guarantee’ programme, and additional funding for HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC)
compliance activity. In 2028-29, the final year of the Spending Review, the government has
reduced RDEL by £1.1 billion, more than explained by a £1.4 billion reduction to the overall
envelope which has been allocated across non-NHS departments (the new RDEL
departmental settlements are detailed in Table 5.5).

3.25

After the end of the current Spending Review period in 2028-29, as is usual there are no
departmental spending allocations and instead the Government sets an overall assumption
for total RDEL spending. In the Budget, the Government has stated that it intends to reduce
total RDEL spending that will be allocated to departments by £4.0 billion in 2029-30 and
£4.9 billion (a 0.8 per cent reduction in the RDEL envelope) in 2030-31 compared to the
assumption set at Spring Statement 2025. This is partially offset by a change to the
Treasury’s assumption on the amount by which departments could underspend against this
assumed total. Overall, this means that the assumption for total RDEL spending has been
reduced by £1.8 billion in 2030-31 in this Budget.

3.26

Capital departmental spending (CDEL) has also been increased over the 2025 Spending
Review period compared to the plans set at the Spring Statement. In the July Spending
Review there was a reprofiling of CDEL plans, increasing budgets by £3.3 billion in 202627, before reducing them by £0.6 billion in 2027-28, £0.9 billion in 2028-29 and £1.8
billion in 2029-30. In this Budget there are further additions to CDEL of £1.7 billion over
the Spending Review period which include additional funding for the lower Thames crossing
construction and the warm homes programme. In net terms, we expect that the effects of
these policy decisions will mean that CDEL is £0.3 billion higher in 2026-27, reflecting our
expectation of a large underspend against this new frontloaded profile.

Special education needs and disabilities policy
3.27

In the summer, the Government announced that it would extend to the end of 2027-28 the
‘statutory override’ of the local authority deficits resulting from the costs of special
educational needs and disabilities (SEND) provision exceeding the Dedicated Schools Grant
(DSG) that those authorities receive from the Department for Education. The statutory
override allows local authorities to disregard these deficits when meeting their statutory duty
to have a balanced budget each year. We included the cost of this extension, which is
estimated at £3.7 billion in 2026-27 and £4.9 billion in 2027-28, in the pre-measures
forecast because we judged it has been affecting in-year spending by local authorities. We
also assumed in the pre-measures forecast that, because there was no policy to reduce
SEND demand growth, these pressures would still need to be funded after the override
expires. We discuss this in more detail in Chapter 5.

Economic and fiscal outlook

68

Policy measures

3.28

The Government has now announced in this Budget that it will fund the full cost of SEND
provision from within central government departmental spending from 2028-29. This is
estimated to cost £6.3 billion in 2028-29, and the Government has not set out how it
intends to fund this from within the current RDEL allocations. To reflect this and other
pressures on RDEL discussed in Chapter 5, we have reduced our assumption for RDEL
underspending in 2028-29 from the £1.9 billion we had assumed in our pre-measures
forecast to zero. We have also reduced local authority spending from 2028-29 by £2.6
billion on average, which is the estimated net effect of removing the cost of SEND from local
authorities, partially offset by assuming this change would allow local authorities to increase
borrowing for capital spending.

Receipts measures announced in this Budget
Freezes to personal tax thresholds
3.29

3.30

This Budget extends the freezes of personal tax thresholds for a further three years from
2028-29 to 2030-31. As a result:
•

The income tax personal allowance, the higher-rate threshold and additional-rate
threshold are frozen at £12,570, £50,270 and £125,140, respectively, until 2030-31.

•

The NICs secondary threshold is frozen until 2030-31. This threshold was reduced
from £9,100 to £5,000 as part of the changes to employer NICs announced at
Autumn Budget 2024.

Together, the freezes to personal tax thresholds are expected to raise £8.3 billion in 202930, £7.6 billion of which relates to income tax threshold freezes (these figures differ from
those in Table 3.1 due to an error in the costing that was reflected in the forecast). We
expect workers to shift part of the incidence of the tax increase onto employers, by
bargaining for a higher nominal wage. The impact of this on nominal wages and profits is
captured in the behavioural adjustment to the costing, which increases the estimated yield
by £0.2 billion in 2029-30. These policies extend the freezes to personal tax thresholds that
were introduced by previous governments initially covering 2019-20 and 2020-21 before
being frozen again from 2022-23. The combined impact of these previous policies and the
freezes announced in this Budget is described in Box 3.3.

Box 3.3: Implications of personal tax threshold freezes
This Budget has extended the allowances and threshold freezes in income tax and National
Insurance contributions (NICs) to the end of the forecast period. This means the majority will
have been frozen for most of the 2020s. Freezing thresholds, rather than raising them in line
with inflation, increases tax receipts as rising wages tip ever greater numbers of workers into the
tax system or onto higher rates, which is known as ‘fiscal drag’.
After an initial freeze covering two years from April 2019 and then an increase with CPI inflation
in 2021-22, the income tax personal allowance (PA) and the higher-rate threshold (HRT) were
frozen at £12,570 and £50,270, respectively, from 2022-23 to 2025-26.a These freezes were
extended for a further two years to 2027-28 in November 2022, and this Budget has extended
them to 2030-31. Had the PA and HRT instead moved in line with inflation, they would be
forecast to be £4,900 and £20,100 higher, respectively, by 2030-31.
In November 2022, the additional-rate threshold (ART) was lowered from £150,000 to
£125,140 from April 2023 to align with the PA taper. This was the first change to the ART since it
was introduced at £150,000 in April 2010 and it will remain frozen until 2030-31. Overall, the
changes to income tax covering the freezes at the basic, higher and additional rates are forecast
to yield a total of £56 billion in 2030-31, of which £12 billion is from the freezes announced at
this Budget (Table A).
The secondary threshold freeze for employer NICs has been extended for an additional three
years until 2030-31 at this Budget, after initially being frozen from 2023-24 to 2027-28 in
November 2022. This threshold was also reduced from £9,100 to £5,000 in the changes to
employer NICs announced at Autumn Budget 2024. Overall, the freeze to the employer NICs
secondary threshold is forecast to yield around £11 billion in 2030-31, of which £0.9 billion is
from the freezes announced at this Budget.
In March 2022, the primary threshold and lower profits limit for employee NICs were increased
to align with the PA (with an equivalent rise in Class 2 NICs) and then frozen until 2025-26, a
freeze which was extended in November 2022 to 2027-28. Although the freeze to the primary

Economic and fiscal outlook

70

Policy measures

threshold has offset some of the negative yield from the initial alignment with the PA, the overall
yield is still negative at £0.4 billion by 2030-31.
By the end of the forecast period, Table A shows that the overall impact of the freezing of all
allowances and thresholds on receipts is estimated to be £67 billion (1.8 per cent of GDP), of
which the freezes announced at this Budget contribute £13 billion in 2030-31. The estimated
cost in 2027-28, when the previous set of freezes were set to end, is £3.3 billion higher than in
our March 2025 forecast, as a result of higher nominal earnings in this forecast. Frozen
thresholds are the largest contributor to the overall increase in the tax take this decade –
responsible for almost three-fifths of the 3.1 per cent of GDP increase in taxes from 2022-23 to
2030-31.

The previously announced freezes and the extensions at this Budget are now expected to mean
that between 2022-23 and 2030-31, 5.2 million additional individuals will have been brought
into paying income tax, 4.8 million more will have moved to the higher rate, and 600,000 more
onto the additional rate (Chart B). Compared to our March forecast, where freezes were due to
end from April 2028, we estimate that these numbers are 780,000, 920,000, and 4,000 higher,
respectively, in 2029-30, largely as a result of the extensions announced in the Budget.b Overall,
the freezes have led to the forecast proportion of taxpayers being at either the higher or
additional rate increasing from 15 per cent in 2021-22 to 24 per cent in 2030-31.

This freeze began in April 2019 for two tax years (2019-20 and 2020-21), then was unfrozen in April 21 for one tax year (202122) and was then frozen again since April 22 at £12,570. The analysis in this Box only considers the impact of the freezes from
2022-23 onwards.

The changes from our March 2025 forecast will largely be accounted for by the extension to the threshold freezes outlined in this
Box but there will be further, smaller impacts from forecast and modelling changes.

Charging NICs on salary-sacrificed pensions contributions
3.31

Salary-sacrificed pension contributions above an annual £2,000 threshold will no longer be
exempt from NICs from April 2029. This means that salary-sacrificed pension contributions
above £2,000 will be treated as ordinary employee pension contributions in the tax system
and therefore be subject to both employer and employee NICs. Ordinary employer pension
contributions will remain exempt from NICs. The policy results in an increase in NICs which
is estimated to raise £4.7 billion in 2029-30 and £2.6 billion in 2030-31.

3.32

The costing assumes that in most cases employee pension contributions above £2,000 that
were part of a salary-sacrifice scheme will become subject to employer and employee NICs,
either because they move to a standard pension scheme or continue in a salary-sacrifice
scheme under the new tax arrangements. The estimated yield from this measure is subject to
uncertainties related to potential responses to the change by employers and employees:
•

Employers switching to ordinary contributions: Employers could look to replicate the
tax benefits of salary-sacrifice by reducing future wage growth and instead providing
employees with higher employer pension contributions. It would also be possible to
formally replicate salary-sacrifice through an agreement to reduce wages and increase
employer pensions contributions. However, this behaviour would be constrained by
interactions with Operational Remuneration Agreement (OpRA) rules and employment

Economic and fiscal outlook

72

Policy measures

law meaning that such reductions would need to be agreed with the entire workforce,
so this is unlikely to be a widespread response. Overall, we estimate these responses
could reduce the yield by £0.7 billion by 2030-31.
•

Employees switching to relief at source (RAS) schemes: The costing assumes many
employees will switch to making ordinary pension contributions, some of which will be
to RAS schemes. Where an employee contributes to a RAS scheme, they will initially
pay higher- and additional-rate income tax on their pension contributions, and then
reclaim this through their self-assessment return in the next year. This creates a
temporary timing effect as employees switching from salary-sacrifice to RAS in 202930 pay increased tax in that year, and then reclaim it in 2030-31, boosting 2029-30
receipts by £1.6 billion. Beyond the forecast period, this effect becomes small.

•

Pass-through: As with the October 2024 changes to employer NICs rates and
thresholds, we assume employers will seek to pass 76 per cent of this additional cost to
employees. In this case, we assume that of this 50 per cent is passed to employees
through lower ordinary employer contributions, which are not taxed, and 50 per cent
is passed through lower salaries and bonuses, which are taxed. Overall, this reduces
the yield from the measure by £0.7 billion by 2030-31.

Increases to income tax rates on property, savings, and dividends
3.33

The Budget announces several changes to the non-labour components of income tax.
Together, these measures are estimated to raise £2.1 billion by 2029-30. These changes
include:
•

From April 2026, a 2 percentage point increase to the basic and higher rates of tax on
dividends, raising them to 10.75 and 35.75 per cent respectively. This is estimated to
yield £1.2 billion a year on average from 2027-28. This includes the behavioural
impact of individuals reducing their taxable dividend income in response to the
measure, which is more than offset by a reduced incentive to incorporate in order to
reduce tax liabilities. There is also a forestalling effect as taxpayers are estimated to

Economic and fiscal outlook

Policy measures

bring forward £0.3 billion of income tax liabilities to 2025-26 (impacting 2026-27
receipts) which is unwound over the following two years.
•

From April 2027, a 2 percentage point increase to the basic, higher and additional
rates of saving income tax, increasing them to 22, 42 and 47 per cent respectively.
This is estimated to yield £0.5 billion a year on average from 2028-29 which includes
a small behavioural response, largely as individuals move more savings into ISAs,
reducing the average annual yield by £0.1 billion.

•

From April 2027, a 2 percentage point increase to the basic, higher and additional
rates of property income tax, increasing them to 22, 42 and 47 per cent respectively.
This is estimated to yield £0.5 billion a year on average from 2028-29. The costing
incorporates a small negative impact as a result of the pass-through of the tax
increasing rents and property tax receipts, which is more than offset by a reduction in
house prices reducing other receipts. The potential long-term impact of higher
property taxation is discussed in paragraph 3.79.

Writing down allowances
3.34

The Budget announces a reduction to the writing down allowance (WDA) main rate from 18
to 14 per cent from April 2026, alongside a new 40 per cent first-year allowance from
January 2026. This is expected to raise £1.5 billion in 2029-30. This measure changes the
capital allowance rates, for both corporation tax paying companies and unincorporated
businesses in the self-assessment regime, on expenditure that does not claim full expensing.
This mostly comprises assets that do not qualify for full expensing such as assets bought for
leasing, second-hand assets, and cars. Of these, only leased assets will be eligible for the
first-year allowance.

3.35

WDAs allow companies to deduct a percentage of the cost of capital assets from their
taxable profit each year, with the remaining asset value added to the company’s capital

asset pool to claim further WDAs in the following year on a reducing balance basis.
Lowering the main rate therefore reduces the tax benefits of WDAs for companies. The new
first-year allowance allows businesses to deduct 40 per cent of the cost of qualifying assets
from taxable profits in the year of purchase, though excludes second-hand assets and cars.
This increased first-year allowance would therefore be expected to offset the disincentives for
investment that the lower WDA rate introduces for leased assets, but not for second-hand
assets and cars.

Changes to the taxation of electric vehicles
Mileage-based charge on electric cars
3.36

The Government has announced changes to the taxation of and subsidies for electric
vehicles (EVs). The most significant is the introduction of a new mileage-based charge on
electric cars, additional to the current vehicle excise duty (VED) charges paid by all vehicles,
which will be introduced in April 2028. In 2028-29, the charge will equal £0.03 per mile
for battery electric cars and £0.015 per mile for plug-in hybrid cars, with the rate per mile
increasing annually with CPI. The average driver of a battery electric car in 2028-29 driving
8,500 miles is therefore expected to be charged £255 in this year. This is roughly equivalent
to half the rate of fuel duty tax paid per mile by drivers of petrol and diesel vehicles. See
from paragraph 3.81 for discussion on the long-term fiscal impacts of this policy.

3.37

The new charge is expected to raise £1.1 billion in 2028-29, rising to £1.9 billion in 203031 (Table 3.7). The yield from the measure is uncertain as it dependent on the uptake of
electric vehicles over the next five years. The Government’s zero-emission vehicle (ZEV)
mandate requires EVs to make up an increasing minimum proportion of total manufacturer
sales over the next five years, reaching 80 per cent in 2030. This new charge is likely to
reduce demand for electric cars as it increases their lifetime cost. To meet the mandate,
manufacturers would therefore need to respond through lowering prices or reducing sales
of non-EV vehicles.11 Overall, as a result of this measure, we estimate there will be around
440,000 fewer electric car sales across the forecast period relative to the pre-measures
forecast, with 130,000 of this offset by the expected increase in sales due to other Budget
measures described below.12 This behavioural response to the policy, along with a small

11

There are flexibilities that allow manufacturers’ sales to be below the mandate levels including through reducing the carbon emissions
of non-EV vehicles. However, we already assume in the baseline pre-measures forecast that manufacturers will make full use of these
flexibilities over the forecast period.
12
In addition to the measures outlined in paragraph 3.38, the policy costing also accounted for interactions with other Budget policies,
including changes to the emissions regulations of plug-in hybrid vehicles, and the introduction of VAT on additional payments and
insurance premium tax on vehicles leased from the Motability scheme.

expected reduction in the average mileage of an electric car, is expected to reduce the yield
by around £0.2 billion by 2030-31.

Other changes affecting electric vehicles
3.38

The Government has also announced a set of measures designed to increase the incentive
to purchase electric vehicles. These are considered in the estimated behavioural response to
the new mileage-based charge on electric cars, set out above. An increase to the expensive
car supplement (ECS) threshold for battery electric cars, from £40,000 to £50,000 in April
2026, costs £0.5 billion in 2030-31. The ECS is an additional VED charge which is spread
over five years, commencing a year after the vehicle is first registered, totalling £2,370 for a
car purchased in 2025-26. The Government has also expanded the electric car grant
between 2025-26 and 2029-30 at an average cost of £0.3 billion in these years.

Gambling duty reform
3.39

Several changes to gambling duties have been announced in the Budget which overall are
estimated to raise £1.1 billion by 2029-30. From April 2026 there will be an increase in
remote gaming duty from 21 to 40 per cent and abolition of bingo duty from its current 10
per cent rate. From April 2027, a new rate of general betting duty for remote betting will be
introduced at 25 per cent, excluding self-service betting terminals, spread betting, pool bets,
and horseracing. The Government has also announced a freeze in casino gaming duty
bands in 2026-27 with the usual RPI uprating thereafter.

3.40

The behavioural responses to these changes are uncertain but are estimated to reduce the
yield by around one-third. We estimate that operators will seek to pass through around 90
per cent of the duty increases by increasing prices or reducing payouts, leading to a
reduction in consumer demand which reduces the yield from the measure by £0.5 billion by
2029-30. The elasticities used to estimate the demand effect also capture potential
substitution to the illicit market, and substitution between different forms of gambling due to
the tax differentials introduced through this policy. We also assume that operators will over
time restructure their product offering to minimise tax costs, given the policy creates wide
differentials between rates across different forms of gambling, reducing the yield by a
further £0.1 billion.

Capital gains tax relief on employee ownership trusts
3.41

The Government has announced that the capital gains tax relief on disposals to employee
ownership trusts (EOT) will be reduced from 100 per cent to 50 per cent from November
2025. EOTs are a corporate ownership structure whereby a controlling interest in a
company is held by the trustees. Previously, company owners who made a qualifying
disposal of shares to the trustees of an EOT benefited from 100 per cent relief of CGT, but
under this measure, 50 per cent of gains will be treated as chargeable gains and subject to
CGT. We estimate this will raise £0.9 billion a year on average from 2027-28 onwards.
This includes a behavioural effect which reduces the costing to reflect individuals mitigating
their CGT tax liability through means such as holding onto shares longer before realising
gains. We use a lower behavioural elasticity for this measure than in previous CGT costings.
This is to reflect that our standard elasticities previously accounted for the use EOTs to
reduce CGT liability, which will be smaller as a result of this measure. Furthermore, we
assume there will be a lower behavioural effect by CGT taxpayers who use EOTs for
retirement purposes.

High value council tax surcharge
3.42

The Government has announced the introduction of a new high value council tax surcharge.
From April 2028, owners of properties identified as being valued at over £2 million by the
Valuation Office (in 2026 prices) will be liable for a recurring annual charge which will be
additional to existing council tax liability. There will be four price bands with the surcharge
rising from £2,500 for a property valued in the lowest £2 million to £2.5 million band, to
£7,500 for a property valued in the highest band of £5 million or more, all uprated by CPI
inflation each year. This measure is estimated to raise £0.4 billion in 2029-30. The
revenues will flow to central government rather than remain with local government, as is the
case for standard council tax.

3.43

We assume over time there will be full pass-through of the cost of the surcharge into the
prices of the liable properties, as well as price bunching to just below each band boundary.
This slightly reduces the estimated yield by reducing the number of properties in scope of
the measure and moving properties into lower charging bands. It also results in lower yield
from other property taxes (including stamp duty land tax and capital gains tax) which
accounts for the negative yield from the measure in the near term shown in Table 3.9. The
behavioural response also includes some expected non-compliance and appeals.

77

Economic and fiscal outlook

Policy measures

3.44

This costing assumes that some current council tax exemptions will apply and that there will
be a deferral scheme for those unable to pay immediately. However, the Government has
announced a consultation on the details of the reliefs and exemptions, the design of an
appeals system, and the deferral and support mechanisms that will be available. Should the
outcome of this consultation materially affect the expected yield of this measure we will
adjust the costing at a future fiscal event.

Fuel duty freeze
3.45

The Government has announced a five-month freeze to fuel duty rates until September
2026 at which point it states that the five pence cut first introduced in 2022 will be reversed
through a staggered approach. From April 2027, the Government has stated that the fuel
duty rates will then be uprated annually by RPI. This costs £2.4 billion in 2026-27 and an
average of £0.9 billion in every subsequent year of the forecast. Previously announced
increases to fuel duty rates have now been postponed for 16 consecutive years. The total
cost of fuel duty freezes from 2010-11 to 2026-27 has risen to £120 billion (see paragraph
3.73). This latest iteration therefore clearly represents a significant risk to the forecast. In
Chapter 7, we show the impact on the margins by which the Government’s fiscal rules are
met were rates to remain frozen across the forecast period.

Business rates
3.46

The Budget includes several changes to business rates. These includes changes to the
multipliers which are used to uprate business rates each year, which will reduce rates for
retail, hospitality and leisure properties, and increase rates for high value properties. A
transitional relief package will also cap increases following revaluations due in 2026. There
are also extensions to measures which allow certain local authorities to retain a higher
proportion of business rates revenue locally. Together, the measures reduce receipts by
£1.2 billion on average between 2026-27 and 2028-29, but are broadly neutral by the end
of the forecast as the transitional relief package and local retentions are due to expire.

Sizewell C RAB levy
3.47

In July 2025, the Government made a final investment decision on the Sizewell C nuclear
power plant, which will be the first nuclear power station in the UK financed using a
regulated asset base (RAB). The RAB model levies an additional charge on consumer energy
bills which contributes to the financing costs of Sizewell C and is projected to generate

Economic and fiscal outlook

78

Policy measures

receipts of £0.7 billion in 2026-27, the first full year of the levy, rising to £1.4 billion in
2030-31. Receipts are offset by £0.2 billion of spending on debt owed to private sector
investors in 2026-27, rising to £0.4 billion in 2030-31. The main uncertainty associated
with this costing is the projected construction costs of Sizewell C during the forecast period.
Previous nuclear power plant construction projects, such as Hinkley Point C, have taken
longer to build and had higher costs than initially anticipated.

Tax administration, compliance and debt collection measures
3.48

The Government has announced a large number of HMRC administration, compliance, and
debt collection measures in the Budget, which are together estimated to raise an additional
£2.3 billion by 2029-30.

3.49

The package includes measures which target specific sections of the tax gap, such as
multinational company transfer pricing, fraud in the construction industry, non-compliant
tax-advisors, late filers, and the use of image rights to avoid employment income, as well as
a reward scheme for informants. There are also measures to strengthen HMRC access to
and use of various data to make compliance efforts more efficient. Further measures target
tax debt through placing additional flow of debt with debt collection agencies (DCA) in
2030-31, expanding the use of DCA for collecting older tax debts, and increasing HMRC
debt management staff.

3.50

The costings of these measures include several adjustments to reach a central estimate of
yield. Most include an ‘attrition’ adjustment to reflect that over time there will be a decline in
the yield from a new measure as firms or individuals discover alternative routes to reduce
their tax liabilities or to avoid tax. The level of attrition applied is based on the likely
behaviour of the groups affected.13 For example, we have applied a high rate of attrition to
a measure which targets tax advisors who are deliberately facilitating non-compliance. For
other compliance measures, which involve complex HMRC operational delivery changes or
where the costing is based on limited data or evidence, an optimism bias adjustment will be
applied to account for high levels of uncertainty in the costing methodology. The measures
we have judged as highly uncertain are detailed in Table 3.10 below.

3.51

In our scrutiny of these costings we also consider their overall impact on the projected tax
gap – a measure of the difference between tax collected and theoretical tax liabilities. This
was estimated to be 5.3 per cent of tax liabilities in 2023-24, the latest year for which
HMRC publishes an estimate, and has been stable around this level since 2017-18. Chart
3.5 shows that the cumulative effect of compliance and debt policies announced since the
March 2023 Budget is estimated to reduce this by 0.7 percentage points by 2030-31.14
HMRC has estimated an illustrative counterfactual tax gap by projecting the current tax gap
across the forecast period assuming it remains constant as a share of tax liabilities.

13

OBR, Briefing paper No. 6: Policy costings and our forecast, 2014.
We now include the yield from debt collection measures in the tax gap projections. Debt management measures both accelerate the
collection of tax debt and reduce amounts that would otherwise be lost through write-off or remission. It is only the latter that reduces the
tax gap. The proportion of additional tax revenue that debt measures contribute towards closing the tax gap is calculated by HMRC using
the age of debt in scope of each measure and the estimated impairment rate.
14

79

Economic and fiscal outlook

Policy measures

3.52

The latest HMRC tax gap publication shows that a significant source of recent upward
pressure on the overall tax gap has come from the tax gap attributed to small businesses,
which has increased to 60 per cent in 2023-24.15 Many of the compliance measures
announced are designed to target non-compliance from small businesses. HMRC estimates
that the compliance package will target around one-third of the small business tax gap.

3.53

This historical and estimated future path of the tax gap continues to indicate both upside
and downside risk to the forecast. The projected decrease in the tax gap would follow the
period since around 2017-18 where it has been relatively stable, despite previous
governments introducing a wide range of measures aimed at increasing tax compliance
over this period. However, HMRC has been successful in previous periods, in particular
between 2013 and 2017, in significantly reducing the tax gap. Given these risks we will
continue to monitor and evaluate the tax gap outturn compared to the estimated yield from
compliance and debt measures, and, as set out in the article we published in October
2025, will undertake further work with HMRC to further improve the approach used to
produce these costings.16

Policy measures

financial transactions reduces debt in 2026-27 and 2027-28, reflecting our
expectation of a significantly larger allowance for shortfall against the overall
envelope, as it expands. From 2028-29 onwards the net effect is to push up debt by
an average of £2.4 billion.
•

Two measures affecting public sector pension schemes. The Superannuation of British
Coal Staff pensions and indexation of some pre-1997 pensions liabilities held by the
Pension Protection Fund (PPF) both increase payments to scheme members. The total
value of these additional liabilities is accrued to 2025-26 and 2026-27 as a capital
transfer, but this additional up-front spending is offset in PSND and instead spread
over the duration of the time in which payments are made to eligible scheme
members. These payments add an average of £120 million per year to debt over the
remainder of the forecast.
•

Sales of assets by the Nuclear Liabilities Fund (NLF), and the Atomic Weapons
Establishment (AWE) pension scheme, which reduce PSND by a combined £2 billion in
2026-27.

Classification treatment of policies
3.56

The Government has introduced several new transactions in this Budget. On the advice of
Treasury classification experts and pending an ONS decision on classification we are
recording the new mileage-based charge on electric cars, the international student levy, the
high value council tax surcharge, and the Sizewell C RAB levy, as central government taxes.

3.57

Following an ONS decision we have changed the recording of flows under the Ukrainian
extraordinary revenue acceleration scheme to financial transactions from capital grants.

3.58

The Treasury has also decided to move a number of transactions from departmental
expenditure limits (DEL) to annually managed expenditure (AME) including:
•

block grants to the Scottish government, reverting the decision made in October 2018
to treat all Scottish government current expenditure as AME. Scottish current AME now
consists of the block grant adjustments that the Treasury makes in light of changes in
UK forecasts for welfare and tax policies devolved to Scotland;

•

the construction costs of Sizewell C; and

•

flows under the Greater London Authority business rates retention.

Update on previous measures
3.59

We cannot review and re-cost all previous measures at each fiscal event, but we do look at
those where the original (or revised) costings seem to be under- or over-performing, and
costings that were identified as particularly uncertain.

3.60

We have made several changes to the costings of reforms to the non-domicile regime, but
overall these leave the estimated revenue from the measures in March 2024 and October
2024 broadly unchanged. Modelling improvements and the latest information on the stock
of non-domiciled taxpayers have added to the yield. This is offset by updated data on nondomiciles’ foreign income and gains, which has reduced the yield. We judge that there is
currently no firm evidence to change the estimated impact of the reforms on migration
made in October 2024. Policies in this Budget which increase taxation on wealthy
individuals could further increase the incentive for those ineligible for the new regime to
migrate. However, we have not made an adjustment for this as we judge any effects are
unlikely to be material. The costings remain highly uncertain and contingent on the
behaviour of a small number of wealthy individuals. Initial information on the yield from the
new regime will not be available until early 2027, via self-assessed tax receipts accruing to
the 2025-26 tax year.

3.61

The yield from the October 2024 measure to charge VAT on private school fees has been
revised up slightly by an average of £40 million per year, driven by the updated forecast for
average earnings that is used to project fee growth. The largest source of uncertainty in this

Economic and fiscal outlook

82

Policy measures

costing is the change in the number of students attending private schools. We have not
changed the estimate made in October 2024 of a long-term decrease in total pupil
numbers of 6 per cent (around 35,000 pupils), most of which we project will have been
realised by 2029-30. A May 2025 Independent Schools Council (ISC) census finds a 5 per
cent decline in pupil numbers at key entry points (Reception, Year 3, and Year 7) for the
2024-25 school year,17 which provides initial support for this assumption. We will continue
to monitor these trends as new information becomes available.

Update on previous indirect effects judgements
3.62

Together with the Treasury and departments responsible for implementation of the various
policy measures, we have established transparent processes for monitoring and evaluation
(M&E) of the supply-side impacts on policies on potential output. These processes check
whether observed outcomes are consistent with the assumptions underpinning our economy
forecast. We judge that the latest evidence supports our previous judgements, but some
notable developments present some risk to our forecast.

3.63

The latest outturn on planning activity suggests that the impact of the March 2025
residential planning reforms is yet to materialise, consistent with our judgement that most of
the increase in housebuilding takes place from 2027-28. Amendments to the Planning and
Infrastructure Bill, for example those which may add new environmental safeguards, and
economic conditions, such as the shortage of viable sites in some parts of the country, pose
downside risks through limiting the release of land for development.

3.64

The latest evidence suggests that the impacts of the policy to increase employer NICs,
announced in Autumn 2024, are broadly in line with expectations. While sharper falls in
employment are evident among lower-paid sectors (Chart 3.6, left panel), it remains
unclear whether this reflects direct behavioural responses to higher employer NICs and the
National Living Wage disproportionately affecting the labour costs of lower-paid individuals,
or wider economic conditions. Survey evidence suggests that, compared to last year, more
firms expect to absorb higher costs through lower profit margins, with fewer planning to
adjust by reducing employment, raising prices or reducing wages (Chart 3.6, right panel).18
However, as the survey does not quantify aggregate impacts on profits, employment or
prices, it remains too early to draw firm conclusions about our original assumptions.

17

Independent Schools Council, ISC Annual Census 2025, May 2025.
According to the latest Bank of England Decision Makers Panel (DMP) survey, 63 per cent of firms reported that lowering profit margins
was their primary adjustment to the changes, compared with 59 per cent who expected this to be the main adjustment in the first DMP
survey following the announcement. In contrast, responses for adjustments such as reducing employment, passthrough to prices, and
lowering wages have declined compared to expectations in November 2024.

So far, observed outturn has been broadly consistent with our assumptions for the impacts
of the policy to increase departmental capital spending announced in Autumn Budget 2024.

Policy risks
3.66

Parliament requires that our forecasts only reflect current government policy. As such, when
the Government sets out ‘policy ambitions’ or ‘intentions’, we ask the Treasury to confirm
whether they represent firm policy. We use that information to determine what should be
reflected in our forecast. Where they are not yet firm policy, we note them as a source of risk
to our central forecast. A full database of risks to this forecast and the changes from
previous updates is available on our website.

3.67

In the Immigration White Paper, the Government announced its intention to extend the
qualifying period for indefinite leave to remain from five to 10 years. While our forecast has
incorporated most of the changes announced in the White Paper, we do not have sufficient
detail on indefinite leave to remain to incorporate these changes. The Government’s stated
intention to consult on asylum policy is also a risk to our forecast.

3.68

The result of the UK-EU strategic partnership and the Youth Mobility Scheme are still being
negotiated and therefore there is not sufficient detail to assess their potential fiscal and
economic impacts. We will consider whether any such impacts should be included in the
forecast once the full details of the agreements have been finalised, published and agreed
by both the EU and UK. This is the standard approach we have taken to assessing the fiscal
and economic impacts of trade deals and other international agreements.

3.69

In March, we outlined our intention to incorporate the Government’s Employment Rights Bill
(ERB) into our forecast this autumn. Since then, the legislative process for the ERB has taken

Economic and fiscal outlook

84

Policy measures

longer than we anticipated, meaning that there is still insufficient detail for us to incorporate
it into our forecast at this event. We plan to include the ERB in our forecast when the policy
is sufficiently detailed.
3.70

The Government has announced that it is retaking the previous decision in response to the
Ombudsman’s findings on the communication of state pension age changes as a result of
legal proceedings, including the decision to not pay compensation to those affected by
increases to the state pension age in the 2010s. We will incorporate any impacts in our
forecast once a new decision has been reached.

3.71

The Government intends to support the Greater London Authority (GLA) and Transport for
London’s (TfL) DLR extension to Thamesmead. It is expected that this will be funded by GLA
and TfL borrowing, with the central government providing support on repayments over the
long term. However, the exact nature of this support is still being negotiated. We will
incorporate this into our forecast when the outcome of this negotiation is sufficiently clear.

Extensions of temporary policies
3.72

The Budget includes several extensions to policies which are described as temporary and
therefore not included in the forecast beyond the short term. This continues a pattern of
such extensions at successive fiscal events. This introduces risk into the medium-term
forecast which is produced on the basis of these temporary policies expiring.

3.73

At this Budget fuel duty rates have again been frozen for a further five months until
September 2026, from when the ‘temporary’ 5p cut to rates introduced at Spring Budget
2022 will be unwound in three stages. The cumulative cost of freezing fuel duty rates
between 2010-11 and 2026-27 and the 5p cut, relative to the stated policy that they will
increase in line with RPI inflation, has risen to £120 billion, after factoring in the negative
impact on demand for fuel from higher duty rates.

3.74

As set out in Chapter 5, exceptional financial support (EFS) for local authorities under
financial stress is set for the year ahead in February each year. Therefore, we do not
currently include any costs for EFS beyond this year. The cost of EFS this year is estimated at
£1.3 billion and it has been rising in recent years.

3.75

Other smaller measures which have been extended through repeated short-term policy
decisions, including at this Budget, are forecast to cost £2.3 billion in 2026-27. The largest
part of this comes from transitional relief for business rates, a scheme that caps bill
increases for some businesses that see large increases due to revaluation. If a similar
package were introduced for the planned 2029 revaluation as was introduced for the 2023
and 2026 revaluations, this would increase 2029-30 borrowing relative to our forecast.
Other smaller extensions include extending the freeze on inheritance tax-free allowances,
extending the universal credit surplus earnings limit, tariff suspension extensions, extending
the business rates retention packages, and extending green first year allowances.

The long-run impact of government policy
3.76

The Charter for Budget Responsibility requires us to assess the long-term impacts of new
government policies, where these are material. We therefore report on new policies with
long-run economic and fiscal impacts, especially where these differ from the effects that will
have occurred by the five-year timeframe at which we are required to produce our mediumterm forecasts.

The long-run economic impact of measures
3.77

The India-UK Free Trade Agreement, if successfully ratified by both countries, will lower tariff
and non-tariff barriers between the UK and India. The Government’s impact assessment
estimates this would increase real GDP by amounts rising to 0.13 per cent by 2040.19

3.78

Other government policies could, if implemented, increase real GDP in the long run. This
includes the Planning and Infrastructure Bill and changes to the Nationally Significant
Infrastructure Project regime. However, limited evidence of significant additional effects
beyond the activity already assumed in our baseline forecast means any potential upside
risks to our forecast from these policies are likely small.

3.79

The measures announced in this Budget reduce returns to private landlords, following
various measures over the past 10 years that have also reduced returns.20 This successive
eroding of private landlord returns will likely reduce the supply of rental property over the
longer run. This risks a steady long-term rise in rents if demand outstrips supply.

The long-run fiscal impact of measures
3.80

We have highlighted the fiscal risk from declining fuel duty revenues due to the transition to
electric vehicles in our Fiscal risk and sustainability reports, with fuel duty revenue projected
to decline from around 0.7 per cent of GDP to 0.1 in the two decades to 2050-51 (Chart
3.7).

3.81

The Budget policy of a new mileage-based charge on battery and plug-in hybrid cars on tax
receipts will mitigate around one-quarter of this long-term risk by 2050-51, when more
than 90 per cent of cars on the road are projected to be fully electric. In this year, the
mileage-based charge is estimated to raise around £7 billion in today’s prices, or around
0.15 per cent of GDP in 2050-51 (Chart 3.7), on the basis of stated Government policy.21
This is only around one-quarter of the expected decline in fuel duty in the two decades to
2050-51 because the mileage-based charge rate has been set to be equal to around half of
the equivalent fuel duty rate paid per mile by drivers of non-electric vehicles, and also

See Department for Business and Trade, Impact assessment of the Free Trade Agreement between the UK and India, 2025.
For example, changes to mortgage interest relief, the stamp duty land tax surcharge and capital gains tax allowances, and the
introduction of the Renters’ Rights Act.
21
To produce these projections, we assume that all new car sales will be zero-emission by 2035 in line with the ZEV mandate. The portion
of the stock of cars that are electric then gradually increases as existing non-electric cars retire and are replaced by new electric cars.

Public sector receipts

Summary of the receipts forecast
4.1

Total public sector receipts are forecast to rise as a share of the economy from 38.9 per
cent of GDP in 2024-25 (£1.1 trillion) to an expected 42.4 per cent of GDP (£1.5 trillion) in
2030-31. Within this, National Accounts taxes as a share of GDP (the ‘tax take’) are
forecast to increase from 34.7 per cent of GDP in 2024-25 to a peak of 38.3 per cent of
GDP by the end of the forecast period. The 2030-31 peak would be a historic high and a
5.4 percentage point increase on the pre-pandemic level of 32.9 per cent of GDP in 201920.

4.2

The main drivers of the forecast 3.6 per cent of GDP increase in the tax take from 2024-25
to 2030-31 are personal taxes (income tax (IT) and National Insurance contributions
(NICs)), which account for 2.3 percentage points of this increase, and capital taxes, which
account for 0.7 percentage points (Table 4.1). The rise in personal taxes this year is mainly
driven by the increase to employer NICs from the measures announced in the Autumn
Budget 2024. Personal taxes are then expected to continue to rise primarily due to earnings
growth combined with the freezes in personal tax thresholds, which were extended for
another three years until April 2031 in this Budget. Capital tax receipts rise across the
forecast period mainly due to projected rises in equity and property prices, and changes to
the inheritance and capital gains tax regimes largely from Autumn Budget 2024.

4.3

Relative to our March 2025 forecast (restated for Blue Book 2025 nominal GDP revisions),1
National Accounts taxes as a share of GDP are forecast to be broadly unchanged this year
but higher by increasing amounts thereafter, and by 1.1 percentage points in 2029-30.
Around two-fifths of the increase in 2029-30 compared to March is due to changes in the
pre-measures forecast, primarily a stronger nominal earnings forecast and higher asset
prices as explained in more detail in Box 4.1, and around three-fifths is accounted for by
the tax policy changes announced in this Budget.

4.4

The National Accounts tax-to-GDP ratio is forecast to be 5.1 percentage points higher in
2030-31 than it was in 2010-11 following the financial crisis (Chart 4.2). This reflects the
following developments over different time periods:
•

2010-11 to 2019-20: The tax-to-GDP ratio was broadly flat over this period. Income
tax and NICs decreased as a share of GDP due to subdued earnings growth and

Economic and fiscal outlook

90

Public sector receipts

increases to the personal allowance. Fuel duty and oil and gas receipts fell due to
successive fuel duty rate freezes, and declining oil and gas prices and North Sea
production. VAT receipts increased more than any other tax as a share of GDP due to
the increase in the standard rate of VAT from 17.5 per cent to 20 per cent in January
2011, and successive falls in the ‘VAT gap’, which measures VAT non-compliance.
•

2019-20 to 2024-25: Nearly all major taxes grew as a share of GDP in this period,
adding 1.8 percentage points to the tax-to-GDP ratio by 2024-25. Income tax and
NICs rose significantly due to the freezing of personal tax thresholds from 2022-23
and the subsequent period of high inflation. This was partially offset by a 1 percentage
point fall in NICs as a share of GDP between 2022-23 and 2024-25 after the
successive 2p cuts to the employee NICs rate in 2023 and 2024. The rise in onshore
corporation tax was driven by the increase in the main rate from 19 per cent to 25 per
cent in April 2023 and resilient profits in higher tax-paying sectors. Oil and gas
receipts rose sharply in 2022-23 due to high energy prices and the introduction of the
energy profits levy, then fell back as prices declined. Fuel duty was the only major tax
to see a persistent fall after the pandemic because of successive duty rate freezes, the
5p rate cut, and increasing uptake of electric vehicles.

•

2024-25 to 2030-31: The further forecast increase in the tax take of 3.6 per cent of
GDP over this period is mainly driven by further expected growth in personal taxes and
capital taxes. The increase this year is due to the employer NICs measure announced
at Autumn Budget 2024, with further near-term strength driven by strong forecast
nominal earnings growth. This Budget’s extension to personal tax thresholds freezes
until April 2031 is the main driver of IT and NICs receipts continuing to grow as a
share of GDP across the forecast. Capital taxes are also forecast to rise due to
expected increases in equity and property prices and recent policy changes.

Decomposing the increase in the projected tax-to-GDP ratio of 5.4 percentage points from
2019-20 to 2030-31 into the impact of forecast and policy changes:
•

The inherited, pre-2019 tax system adds 0.8 percentage points to the tax-to-GDP
ratio.

•

Underlying forecast changes add an additional 0.8 percentage points.

•

The direct impacts of the previous Governments’ policy decisions since Spring 2020
increase it by a further 1.7 percentage points of GDP between 2019-20 and 2030-31,
primarily through freezes to personal tax thresholds and the increased headline rate of
corporation tax.

•

The direct impacts of the current Government’s policy decisions add a further 2.1
percentage points to the tax-to-GDP ratio between 2025-26 and 2030-31, through
the further personal tax threshold freezes announced in this Budget, the Autumn
Budget 2024 increases to employer NICs, and the range of wider tax increases
announced at both of these events.

4.6

There is significant uncertainty around the forecast increase in the tax take over the next five
years. Historically, the average absolute five-year forecast error for receipts as a share of
GDP is 0.9 percentage points. Chart 4.3 shows that, in addition to the impact of recent tax
policy changes, changes to the outlook for the tax-to-GDP ratio have been driven by
revisions to the underlying forecast. Much of the expected increase in the tax take across the
forecast is from income tax and NICs, and from capital taxes (Table 4.1).

Economic and fiscal outlook

92

Public sector receipts

4.7

The rising yield from income tax and NICs is mainly driven by the personal tax threshold
freezes, which are paid by a broad base of taxpayers meaning they are less sensitive to
changes in behaviour. However, they are highly sensitive to inflation and nominal earnings
growth, which is illustrated below. Capital taxes are paid by a narrower base of typically
higher-income taxpayers and are often very sensitive to the behavioural responses to policy
changes. They are also highly sensitive to growth in asset values, such as equity prices, that
are particularly volatile and hard to forecast. The forecasts for all major taxes are also
sensitive to the evolution of the tax gap, a measure of the degree of tax compliance, which
is discussed further in paragraphs 3.48 to 3.53. More generally, a higher level of the tax
take increases the risk that incentives within the tax system distort or constrain economic
activity by more than expected.

4.8

In Chart 4.4, we use ready reckoners to illustrate the sensitivity of the receipts forecast to
some of these factors. In these scenarios, we assume that annual growth in average
earnings, nominal consumption, and equity prices are higher (upside) or lower (downside)
than our central forecast by their median absolute forecast difference in each year.2
Additionally, we assume the tax gap remains flat as a share of GDP from 2023-24
(downside),3 or falls as a share of GDP by double the rate of our central forecast (upside):
•

In the upside scenario, receipts are higher by an average of around £28 billion over
the forecast period and by £42 billion (1.1 per cent of GDP) in 2030-31. The largest
driver is the impact of higher nominal earnings on income tax and NICs, boosting
receipts by £17 billion in 2030-31, while higher equity prices increase capital gains tax
(CGT) and interest and dividend receipts by £12 billion. The narrowing of the tax gap
raises receipts by around £8 billion and higher nominal consumption increases VAT
receipts by around £5 billion in 2030-31.

•

In the downside scenario, receipts are lower by a broadly symmetric amount, reducing
receipts by £40 billion, or 1.1 per cent of GDP in the final year.

2

The median absolute forecast difference is calculated as the median value of the differences between outturns and the central forecasts
since the OBR was established in 2010. The median value is used as it is less skewed by shocks such as the Covid pandemic. These
differences broadly increase each year over the forecast period where the average difference across the five-year forecast period is 1.8
per cent for nominal earnings, 2.1 per cent for nominal consumption, and 7.4 per cent for equity prices.

Change in receipts since our March 2025 forecast
4.9

Relative to our March 2025 forecast, and including the impact of Budget measures, total
public sector receipts are forecast to be £2.0 billion higher in 2025-26, rising to £38 billion
higher in 2029-30 (1.1 per cent of GDP):4
•

Underlying forecast differences drive little change in forecast receipts this year, but
then increase receipts by a broadly stable amount over the rest of the forecast period,
and by £14 billion in 2029-30 (Table 4.2). The main contribution to this is from a
higher nominal earnings forecast driving increased IT and NICs receipts. There are
further upward contributions from a stronger consumption forecast driving higher VAT
receipts, and higher equity prices boosting CGT and interest and dividend receipts
(Table 4.2). Box 4.1 discusses the impact of various economic factors on the premeasure receipts forecast in more detail.

•

Fiscally neutral receipts, which are those offset in spending, raise receipts by £2.2
billion in 2029-30. This is largely driven by higher public sector depreciation due to
upward revisions to the size of the capital stock, and higher council tax receipts. This is
partly offset by the decrease in revenue from VAT refunds.

•

The direct effect of policy measures announced at this Budget adds £0.7 billion to
receipts in 2026-27 and then raises receipts by increasing amounts reaching £26
billion in 2029-30. Around £8 billion of this is due to the extension of personal tax
threshold freezes, £5 billion is due to changes to salary-sacrificed pension
contributions, and the remaining £13 billion is due to the other tax measures. As a

share of GDP, the policies in this Budget deliver the third-largest medium-term tax
increase since the OBR was established in 2010, after Spring Budget 2021 and
Autumn Budget 2024.
•

The indirect effects of policy measures announced at this Budget reduce receipts by
£4.1 billion in 2029-30, which offsets around a sixth of the increase to receipts from
the direct effect of Government decisions. Policy measures reduce near-term inflation,
which lowers average earnings and reduces IT and NICs receipts by £2.3 billion in
2029-30. The downward impact of the tax increases on real household disposable
income (RHDI) also reduce VAT receipts by £1.0 billion in 2029-30. This is explained
further in paragraph 3.16.

Public sector receipts

Box 4.1: Change in pre-measures tax receipts relative to the March 2025 forecast
Compared to March 2025, the pre-measures receipts forecast has increased by £16 billion in
2029-30. In this box, we explore how changes in the economy forecast drove these changes to
the tax forecast including through:
•

the 0.3 percentage point a year downgrade to our productivity forecast;

•

a 0.5 percentage point average increase in our pre-measures forecast of CPI inflation this
year and next, which contributes to a 0.9 percentage point average increase in our premeasures forecast for nominal earnings growth this year and next, and a 0.4 percentage
point average increase in nominal consumption growth over this year and next; and

•

how these changes in the forecast for nominal GDP and its components interact with the
different effective tax rates on those components.

Effective tax rates (ETRs) represent the average tax rate paid on a component of expenditure and
income. Chart A shows that there is a difference of around 20 percentage points between the
ETRs on labour (40 per cent) and corporate (17 per cent) incomes, and between those on
consumption (10 per cent) and business investment (-10 per cent) expenditure. This means that
growth in labour income is more tax-rich than growth in corporate profits, and similarly that
growth in consumption is more tax-rich than growth in business investment.
Since the pandemic, the ETRs on labour income and corporate profits have both risen, which has
broadly maintained the differential between them. The freezing of personal tax thresholds and
strong nominal earnings growth have brought an increasing number of individuals into paying
tax, and into higher bands (Box 3.3). This causes the ETR on labour income to rise to a forecast
40 per cent by 2030-31 from below 35 per cent before the pandemic.a The ETR on corporate
profits increased by a similar amount due to the rise in the corporation tax rate from 19 per cent
to 25 per cent in April 2023. The ETRs on consumption and business investment, and the
differential between them, are expected to remain broadly flat from 2021-22.

These differentials in effective tax rates help to explain why the pre-measures receipts forecast in
2029-30 is £16 billion higher than in March (Chart B), despite the downgrade to productivity
growth in this forecast. Based on our standard ready-reckoners, the reduction in the trend
productivity growth forecast of around 0.3 percentage points a year from 2026-27 would have
been expected to mechanically reduce receipts by £16 billion in 2029-30. This is based on
holding all other forecast judgements constant, with compositional shares of income and
expenditure remaining unchanged from our March forecast.b However, a number of other
judgements in the economy forecast more than offset this.c Specifically:
•

A higher near-term inflation forecast by an average 0.5 per cent in this year and next
increases the forecast size of the nominal economy and therefore leads to higher
forecasts for nominal consumption, VAT receipts, profits, corporation tax, and earnings,
with the latter driving higher personal taxes, especially with frozen personal tax
thresholds.d Overall, we estimate this mechanically increases the pre-measures forecast
for nominal receipts by £14 billion in 2029-30.

•

Our forecast for growth in the composition of income within GDP is also now more
skewed toward relatively tax-rich labour income and less skewed toward less heavily
taxed corporate profits. We now expect a shallower decline in the labour share of income
from March, pushing up wage growth, and lower corporate profit growth due to the rate
of return on capital having recently fallen by less than previously thought (see paragraphs
2.47 and 2.48 for more details). All else equal, this would increase receipts by £5 billion
in 2029-30.

•

We also expect more fiscally favourable growth in the composition of expenditure within
GDP. Consistent with the lower forecast for profits, we have revised down cumulative
growth in corporate investment by more than nominal GDP. But we have revised up the
share of nominal GDP that goes to consumption, consistent with higher wage growth.
The composition of nominal consumption has also shifted toward goods that pay the
standard rate of VAT. These changes in the composition of expenditure are estimated to
increase receipts by £5 billion in 2029-30.

•

Other receipts impacts explain the rest of the difference in our pre-measures receipts
forecast from March. These include a boost to capital gains tax receipts due to higher
equity prices, higher business rates due to a changed assessment of the impact of future
revaluations, and increases to forecasts for some fiscally neutral receipts.

a

These are pre-measures effective tax rates that do not include any impact for the direct and indirect effects of the policy measures
announced at this Budget. The post-measures effective tax rate for labour income reaches 42 per cent by 2030-31, mostly driven by
the freezing of personal tax thresholds to 2030-31.
b
This ready-reckoning approach is broadly comparable to the productivity scenarios we present in Chapter 7 of this EFO and the
March 2025 EFO.
c
We have produced this decomposition using ready-reckoners to estimate the approximate total impact of these judgements across
all tax streams. In practice, these judgements interacted with each other in the economy forecast and their impacts on the fiscal
forecast in many cases acted on the same tax streams and so cannot be straightforwardly separated from each other. For example,
the productivity downgrade was one of the factors that informed our judgements on the composition of income and expenditure
growth.
d
In the pre-measures forecast, prior to any policy announcements, personal tax thresholds were forecast to move in line with CPI
inflation from April 2028. The measures announced at this Budget and discussed in Box 3.3 therefore have no impact on the premeasures receipts forecast.

Tax-by-tax analysis
Income tax (excluding self-assessment)
4.10

Income tax (excluding self-assessment, or SA) is forecast to raise £276 billion in 2025-26
(9.1 per cent of GDP), a 7.0 per cent increase on 2024-25. This rise is almost entirely
driven by continued strong growth in nominal earnings combined with frozen tax thresholds.
Receipts are then expected to grow by an average of 5.1 per cent a year to £353 billion
(9.7 per cent of GDP) in 2030-31. This strong growth over the forecast is driven by the
freeze to personal tax thresholds that has been extended in this Budget to the end of 203031, increasing non-SA IT by an average of £7 billion between 2028-29 and 2030-31 (Box
3.3). There is also a temporary boost to receipts between 2026-27 and 2028-29 due to the
Temporary Repatriation Facility (TRF) announced as part of previous reforms to the nondomicile regime.

Economic and fiscal outlook

98

Public sector receipts

4.11

Relative to the March forecast, we expect non-SA IT receipts to be higher by an average of
£7 billion from 2026-27, and by £15 billion in 2029-30. Drivers of this include:
•

The pre-measures forecast for nominal earnings, which is higher by an average of 0.9
percentage points this year and next, increasing the forecast by around £4.4 billion a
year from 2026-27. From 2027-28, the cumulative growth in nominal earnings is
slightly lower than our March 2025 forecast.

•

Other pre-measures factors lower the forecast in every year except 2029-30. The main
driver of this is an update to the skew of PAYE toward NICs rather than IT. This reflects
the latest outturn data, since the end of 2024-25, in which PAYE receipts have been
more skewed to NICs than in our previous forecast. There is no net impact on total
receipts from this as it is exactly offset in higher NICs.

•

Policy changes announced in this Budget are expected to raise non-SA IT by increasing
amounts from 2026-27. The extension of the freeze to personal tax thresholds
increases forecast receipts by around £7 billion in 2029-30. The coding out of SA IT
measure increases PAYE IT receipts by £2.7 billion in 2029-30. Further increases come
from changes to salary-sacrificed pension contributions and measures aimed at
closing the tax gap, including ‘coding out’, which increases PAYE IT receipts in 202930, more-than offsetting a reduction in SA receipts from the measure. These policies
are explained in more detail in Chapter 3.

•

As set out in paragraphs 3.11 to 3.17 the Budget policy package is assumed to have a
set of indirect effects on the economy. By 2029-30 these impacts are forecast to
reduce non-SA IT receipts by £1.5 billion, mainly driven by the impact of lower nearterm inflation on average earnings.

National Insurance contributions (NICs)
4.12

NICs are forecast to raise £205 billion in 2025-26 (6.7 per cent of GDP), a 19.8 per cent
increase on 2024-25. Over two-thirds of this expected increase is due to the employer NICs
measures announced in the Autumn Budget 2024, with the remainder explained by strong
nominal earnings growth. Receipts are then projected to rise steadily by around 4 per cent a
year to £247 billion in 2030-31 (6.8 per cent of GDP), remaining broadly flat as a share of
GDP across the forecast period.

4.13

Relative to the March forecast, NICs are around £5 billion higher in 2025-26, and higher
by an average of £9 billion over the following four years:
•

On a pre-measures basis, higher nominal earnings and the greater skew of PAYE
receipts to NICs (explained in paragraph 4.11) drive the increase in receipts of around
£5 billion this year. Continued strength in nominal earnings drives the pre-measures
strength across the rest of the forecast period and has also driven an increase in the
yield we expect from the Autumn Budget 2024 employer NICs measures impacting the
rate and secondary threshold. This has increased our estimate of the yield by £1.6
billion this year, and an average of £1.8 billion thereafter.

•

The direct effect of policy measures is estimated to increase NICs by nearly £5 billion
in 2029-30. This is largely accounted for by the changes to the regime for salarysacrificed pension contributions and the extension of the secondary threshold freeze for
a further three years to 2030-31.

•

Indirect effects reduce NICs receipts by £0.7 billion in 2029-30, and similar to non-SA
IT this is driven by the lower near-term inflation forecasts.

Self-assessment income tax
4.14

Self-assessed IT is forecast to raise £53 billion in 2025-26 (1.8 per cent of GDP), a 10.6 per
cent increase on 2024-25. SA IT receipts in 2025-26 mainly relate to activity in the previous
financial year, and so this increase is mainly due to growth in savings and self-employment
incomes in 2024-25 combined with frozen tax thresholds. Receipts are then forecast to rise
sharply to £62 billion (2.0 per cent of GDP) in 2026-27, driven by the reforms to the nondomicile tax regime. There is further strong growth expected in 2027-28 to £69 billion (2.1
per cent of GDP) due to the reclassification of carried interest into SA from CGT. Receipts
then rise more steadily across the rest of the forecast and fall slightly as a share of the
nominal economy to £74 billion (2.0 per cent of GDP) in 2030-31.

4.15

SA IT receipts are broadly unchanged compared to the March forecast until 2029-30, when
they are expected to be £2.5 billion lower. Until 2029-30, a lower pre-measures forecast
for dividend income and the impact of fewer company tax motivated incorporations than
assumed in March are largely offset by policy decisions in this Budget. The main effect of
policy is from the increase in SA tax rates across dividend, saving, and property income. The
policy of coding out for self-assessed customers reduces SA IT receipts by £2.1 billion in
2029-30. These policies are explained in more detail in Chapter 3.

VAT
4.16

VAT receipts are forecast to raise £180 billion in 2025-26 (5.9 per cent of GDP), a 3.6 per
cent increase from 2024-25. Receipts are then expected to rise to £224 billion by 2030-31
(6.2 per cent of GDP). The rise as a share of GDP is a result of nominal consumption rising
as a share of GDP over the forecast, an expectation that the composition of household
consumption will shift toward goods paying the standard rate of VAT, and the policies
announced in Autumn Budget 2024 to reduce VAT non-compliance.

101

Economic and fiscal outlook

Public sector receipts

4.17

In the pre-measures forecast receipts have been revised down by £0.8 billion in 2025-26
compared to March. This is primarily explained by the March 2025 Upper Tribunal decision
that ride-hailing services provided by private hire vehicle operators (PHVOs) can be within
the Tour Operators’ Margin Scheme (TOMS), reducing their VAT liabilities.

4.18

Over the rest of the forecast, VAT receipts are higher in each year and are forecast to be
£3.8 billion higher by 2029-30. In 2029-30, the pre-measures forecast is £3.8 billion
higher than March due to a higher forecast for nominal consumption and a higher expected
proportion of goods paying the standard rate of VAT. The measures announced at this
Budget increase VAT receipts by an expected £1.0 billion in 2029-30. Of this increase, £0.7
billion is from the Budget policy to exclude PHVOs from TOMS from January 2026, in
response to the court decision described above. The remaining £0.3 billion comes from
reducing VAT relief on Motability, measures aimed at reducing non-compliance and
collecting tax debt, and other measures. The indirect effects of the Budget policy package
lower VAT receipts by £1.0 billion in 2029-30, due to the personal tax measures reducing
nominal consumption.

Onshore corporation tax
4.19

Onshore corporation tax is expected to raise £97 billion (3.2 per cent of GDP) in 2025-26,
an increase of 5.6 per cent from 2024-25. This increase is driven by higher profits in large
non-financial companies, offset by weaker performance for small companies and financial
companies. Onshore corporation tax is then forecast to rise to £121 billion (3.3 per cent of
GDP) by 2030-31, driven by a rising profit share in the economy from 15.8 per cent of GDP
in 2025-26 to 16.1 per cent of GDP by 2030-31, and due to measures announced in this
Budget.

4.20

Relative to March, onshore corporation tax is expected to be £1.0 billion higher in 2025-26.
This results from higher-than-anticipated profits in this year, and a large payment on

Economic and fiscal outlook

Public sector receipts

historic corporate tax liabilities that was re-allocated from offshore to onshore corporation
tax. These are partly offset by a decrease in financial sector profits from the Financial
Conduct Authority’s motor finance compensation scheme, which reduce receipts by an
estimated £2.0 billion spread over 2025-26 and 2026-27.
4.21

Receipts are expected to be just £0.3 billion higher in 2029-30 than forecast in March. The
pre-measures forecast is £0.7 billion lower in 2029-30 due to a lower forecast recovery in
the profit share relative to March (discussed further in Box 4.1), which is only partially offset
by increases to the forecast due to modelling changes and the higher receipts this year.
Budget policies overall increase receipts by £1.3 billion in 2029-30. The main change is the
reduction in main rate writing down allowances (WDAs) which raises an estimated £1.5
billion in 2029-30.

Oil and gas receipts
4.22

Offshore corporation tax, petroleum revenue tax (PRT), and the energy profits levy (EPL) are
expected to raise £2.7 billion (0.1 per cent of GDP) in 2025-26, a 41.4 per cent decrease
on 2024-25. This is due to a large reallocation of historic tax liabilities from offshore to
onshore corporation tax, and lower oil and gas prices. Receipts are then forecast to decline
to £0.3 billion in 2030-31, primarily due to the expected continued fall in oil and gas
production and the expiry of the EPL in March 2030.

4.23

Relative to our March forecast, oil and gas receipts are expected to be £2.5 billion lower in
2025-26. This reflects significant declines in oil and gas prices, a stronger sterling exchange
rate against the dollar, and the impact of mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activity in the
North Sea reducing receipts. These mergers have allowed companies with a large stock of
tax losses to combine operations with tax-paying companies, allowing greater use of losses
to offset against taxable profits.

4.24

The EPL is due to end on 31 March 2030 unless oil and gas prices fall below the Energy
Security Investment Mechanism (‘ESIM’) threshold. If ESIM is triggered, which would occur if
average oil and gas prices fell below the 2025-26 threshold of $74.21 a barrel of oil and
£0.57 a therm of gas (uprated by CPI each year) for two consecutive quarters, the EPL
would be permanently disapplied. While oil prices are currently forecast to be below the
ESIM threshold, gas prices are above the threshold in this forecast, though only by around
0.04p a therm in the third quarter of 2028.

4.25

Based on current expected prices, the electricity generator levy (EGL) is expected to cease
raising tax in 2025-26, as beyond this point forecast wholesale electricity prices drop below
the benchmark price. Lower prices mean the forecast has been revised downwards by £0.6
billion in 2025-26 and £0.1 billion in 2026-27 relative to March.

Road taxes
4.26

Fuel duty is expected to raise £24 billion (0.8 per cent of GDP) in 2025-26, a 1.6 per cent
decrease from 2024-25. This is due to weaker-than-expected petrol receipts driven by a
103

Public sector receipts

steep fall in clearances. Receipts are then forecast to increase by £0.2 billion (1 per cent) in
2026-27, based on the policy announced in this Budget that the 5p cut is to be unwound in
three stages, with the first reversal expected in September 2026, and duty rates are then
uprated with RPI from 2027-28. Receipts are forecast to peak at £26 billion in 2028-29
before falling by £0.9 billion by 2030-31, reflecting the inflection point where the assumed
increase in fuel duty rates is outweighed by the rising electric vehicle (EV) share.
4.27

In practice, despite successive policy commitments to raise fuel duty rates, they have not
been increased since 2011-12. If the duty rate were to remain unchanged at its current level
throughout the forecast period it would reduce receipts, on average, by £3.6 billion a year
between 2027-28 and 2030-31.

4.28

Relative to our March forecast, receipts are down by £1.5 billion on average over the
forecast, with the largest fall occurring in 2026-27. This is due to the latest delay to the
removal of the 5p cut. Over the long run, as set out in Chart 3.7, we expect fuel duty
receipts to halve by the 2030s and approach zero by 2050-51 due to the transition to EVs,
even assuming uprating with RPI inflation in every year.

4.29

Vehicle excise duty (VED) receipts are expected to raise £9 billion in 2025-26, a 15 per cent
increase compared to 2024-25. This is due to an increase in vehicle registrations and the
impact of VED reforms from previous Budgets which took effect in April 2025. Receipts prior
to the impact of measures are forecast to increase to £12 billion by 2030-31, mainly as a
result of RPI upratings of VED rates and increases in revenue from the expensive car
supplement due to frozen thresholds. Relative to the March forecast, prior to the impact of
measures, receipts are expected to be £0.5 billion higher in 2029-30 due to stronger inyear receipts and registrations data resulting in an increase in the new car sales forecast.

4.30

The Budget policy to introduce a new annual mileage-based charge on battery and plug-in
hybrid electric cars increases VED receipts by around £1.5 billion a year from 2028-29. The
impact of this and related policies is discussed further in paragraphs 3.36 to 3.37.

Capital taxes
4.31

Capital gains tax (CGT) receipts are expected to raise £20 billion in 2025-26 (0.7 per cent
of GDP), around a 50 per cent increase from 2024-25. This is due to evidence of an
increase in the disposal of assets in 2024-25 to benefit from lower rates ahead of
anticipated CGT policy changes at Autumn Budget 2024. Liabilities accrued in that year are
mainly reflected in 2025-26 receipts. Receipts are then forecast to rise to £30 billion in
2030-31 (0.8 per cent of GDP), largely driven by rising equity prices.

4.32

Relative to our March forecast, before the impact of policy measures, receipts are forecast to
be £0.9 billion a year higher on average. This is due to higher equity prices than forecast in
Spring 2025 that more than offset a lower forecast for residential property transactions. The
reduction of CGT relief on employee ownership trusts (EOTs) from 100 per cent to 50 per
cent announced at this Budget adds a further £0.8 billion to receipts by 2030-31.

Economic and fiscal outlook

104

Public sector receipts

4.33

The full extent of forestalling ahead of Autumn Budget 2024 will not be known until the end
of January, when the majority of CGT liabilities are paid, so this remains an area of
significant risk to the 2025-26 receipts forecast. However, analysis of early self-assessment
filers this year suggests that these receipts are substantially higher than previous years and
broadly in line with the full-year assumption. There was also strong growth in residential
property disposals between 2023-24 and 2024-25, observed in data collected through the
Payment on Property Disposals system. Additionally, analysis of Companies House data on
Members’ Voluntary Liquidations indicates an increase in liquidations ahead of Autumn
Budget 2024 and April 2025 (the implementation date for the business asset disposal relief
(BADR) rate change).5

4.34

Property transaction taxes are forecast to raise £16 billion in 2025-26, a 7.9 per cent
increase from 2024-25. This rise partly reflects the late receipt of cash from forestalled
transactions taking place in March 2025 in response to the decrease in nil-rate stamp duty
(SDLT) thresholds from April. Receipts are then forecast to rise steadily to reach £28 billion
in 2030-31, driven by rising property transactions and house prices.

4.35

Relative to our March forecast, receipts are forecast to be around £0.8 billion higher this
year, due to the late receipt of cash in April 2025, and higher in-year outturn, particularly
for non-residential SDLT. By 2029-30, receipts are forecast to be £0.3 billion below our
March forecast, due to a reduction in our forecast for residential property transactions.

4.36

Inheritance tax (IHT) receipts are forecast to raise £9 billion in 2025-26, a 4.5 per cent
increase from last year. Receipts are expected to continue to increase over the forecast,
driven by rising forecast house and equity prices and the impact of the policies announced
in Autumn Budget 2024, reaching £14.5 billion in 2030-31. Relative to our March forecast,
receipts are expected to be £0.8 billion a year lower by 2029-30. This is mainly due to
lower in-year outturn which is only partially offset by higher forecast equity prices.

4.37

The July 2025 Forecast evaluation report identified a modelling development priority to
assess whether the inheritance tax forecast should more fully capture potential cohort effects
due to wealth increasing across generations.6 To evaluate this, we calibrated historic
forecasts to outturn and analysed past fiscal forecasting differences and found no current
evidence of bias relating to cohort effects in the current modelling approach. We will
continue to keep this under review as we receive further outturn data.

Business rates
4.38

Business rates are expected to raise £34 billion (1.1 per cent of GDP) in 2025-26, a rise of
4.9 per cent from 2024-25. This is driven by CPI inflation increasing the standard multiplier
and less generous reliefs for retail, hospitality and leisure (RHL) sectors compared with
2024-25. It is then forecast to rise by 10.2 per cent in 2026-27 due to a 3.75 per cent
increase in gross rates yield from the April 2026 revaluation, a CPI uprating of multipliers,

For a solvent company to formally close, they must go through the process of a ‘Member’s Voluntary Liquidation’ (MVL), which allows
the realisation of a company’s assets. This spike in MVLs could therefore indicate forestalling of such assets ahead of policy changes.

and an increased multiplier for high-value properties being partially offset by the package
of measures capping bill increases announced at this Budget.
4.39

Relative to March, before the impact of measures, business rates receipts are expected to be
£2.7 billion higher in 2029-30. This increase is driven by an updated Ministry of Housing,
Communities and Local Government assessment of the impact of revaluations on business
rates receipts and a higher inflation path pushing up the multiplier. The forecast now
assumes that average rateable values are increased at revaluations by an amount sufficient
to offset future appeals, which is 3.75 per cent of gross rates. This increases revenues in the
year a revaluation takes place – which over the current forecast period is in 2026 and 2029
– and then reduces receipts over time as appeals bring down rateable values. In the March
forecast this positive impact on receipts had been excluded, while the offsetting negative
impact on receipts from compensation being paid out to businesses following appeal was
included.

4.40

The impact of Budget policy measures reduces business rates receipts by an average of
£1.4 billion between 2026-27 and 2028-29, primarily from time-limited measures such as
transitional relief. This is explained further in paragraph 3.46.

Excise taxes
4.41

Alcohol duty receipts are expected to raise £12 billion in 2025-26, a 5.1 per cent decline
relative to 2024-25. Receipts are then anticipated to increase to £14 billion by 2030-31, an
average rise of 3.4 per cent each year, largely driven by increases to the duty rate that more
than offset the impact of lower in-year and forecast consumption. The quantity of alcohol
products sold is forecast to sharply decline by 6.4 per cent this year and remain broadly flat
from 2027-28 (Chart 4.5). This is likely driven by a combination of factors such as a
growing trend of alcohol moderation, with substitution to no- and low-alcohol alternatives,
and a response to higher prices. There may also be an impact from demographic changes,
with some evidence of lower alcohol consumption in younger age groups. Compared to the
March forecast, a lower consumption trend and weak in-year data reduce the forecast for
alcohol receipts by an average of £1.7 billion each year.

4.42

Tobacco duty receipts are expected to raise £8 billion in 2025-26, a 0.8 per cent increase
relative to 2024-25, as the increase to duty rates offsets reductions in consumption. Receipts
are then projected to fall in every year to £7 billion in 2030-31 as consumption continues to
fall sharply, in part due to the substitution from tobacco products towards vaping (Chart
4.5). Vaping duty, effective from October 2026, is expected to raise £0.2 billion in 202627, rising to £0.6 billion by 2030-31, partially offsetting the fall in tobacco receipts across
the forecast. Compared to the March forecast, tobacco receipts are lower by an average of
£0.5 billion, reflecting lower forecast consumption.

Betting and gaming receipts are expected to raise £4 billion in 2025-26, a 9.8 per cent
increase relative to 2024-25. Receipts are then forecast to increase by 24.8 per cent in
2026-27 to £5 billion, driven by the increase to tax rates on remote gambling announced at
this Budget and explained in paragraph 3.39. Thereafter, receipts grow by an average of
4.3 per cent to £6 billion in 2030-31. Compared to the March forecast, receipts are higher
by an average of £1.3 billion, with around four-fifths due to the policy measures announced
at this Budget and the remainder due to strong in-year receipts.

Other receipts
4.44

Emissions trading scheme (ETS) receipts are expected to raise £2.6 billion in 2025-26, a
24.3 per cent decrease compared to 2024-25. This is due to a fall in the carbon price.
Receipts are forecast to decline to £2.3 billion in 2030-31 as the number of allowances
auctioned declines. Relative to our March forecast, receipts are £0.7 billion higher in 202930 due to an increase in forecast carbon prices and the extension of ETS to international
maritime routes.

4.45

Receipts from environmental levies are expected to raise £14 billion in 2025-26. Receipts
are then forecast to rise to £18.6 billion by 2030-31, due to an increase in electricity supply
and generation in the capacity market and contracts for difference (CfD) forecasts, and an
expected £1 billion increase from Sizewell C regulated asset base (RAB) levy receipts.
Hinkley Point C nuclear power station is expected to begin generating electricity in 2030-31,
raising CfD receipts by £1.0 billion in that year. Relative to the March forecast, receipts are
£1.4 billion higher on average between 2026-27 and 2029-30. Within this, Budget policy
decisions, including the introduction of the Sizewell C RAB levy and expanding the warm
home discount, increase receipts by an average of £1.6 billion a year. Environmental levies
are covered in more detail in Box 4.2.

Economic and fiscal outlook

Public sector receipts

Box 4.2: Environmental levies
In our latest forecast, we expect revenues from North Sea taxes (offshore corporation tax,
including ring fence corporation tax and the supplementary charge, petroleum revenue tax, and
the energy profits levy) to fall from £2.7 billion in 2025-26 to £0.3 billion in 2030-31. This
continues the gradual decline in North Sea revenues over several decades due to falling
production levels, which has only been interrupted by periods, such as in 2022, when oil and
gas prices have spiked (Chart C). Box 4.3 in the March 2023 Economic and fiscal outlook has
further detail on the decline in North Sea receipts between 1975 and 2022.
While oil and gas revenues have been on a downward trend since the early 2000s, receipts from
environmental levies on household energy bills have risen from £0.3 billion (less than 0.1 per
cent of GDP) in 2002-03 to £14 billion (0.5 per cent of GDP) in 2025-26, and are expected to
increase to £19 billion (0.5 per cent of GDP) at the forecast horizon.a This reflects a shift away
from the taxation of energy extraction to taxation on the consumption of energy. Most receipts
from environmental levies are directly offset in spending because they are used to provide
subsidies for energy generators. This means they are generally neutral for public sector
borrowing. The schemes include:
•

Contracts for difference (CfD), which is expected to generate £3.2 billion in receipts on
average a year across the forecast period. CfD guarantees a fixed price to energy
generators for future electricity generation, with subsidies provided to renewables
generators when wholesale prices fall below the agreed fixed price. The CfD scheme has
replaced the renewables obligation (RO), which closed to new projects in March 2017,
as the main scheme incentivising investment in renewable electricity projects. RO receipts
are forecast to fall by £1.7 billion across the forecast, while CfD receipts are forecast to
increase by £2.0 billion. The Budget policy to part-fund the RO scheme for three years
temporarily shifts a portion of the costs from domestic energy bills to the Exchequer,
leading to higher borrowing. In 2030-31, CfD is expected to generate £4.6 billion in
receipts including £1.0 billion to fund subsidy payments to the Hinkley Point C nuclear
power plant for its first year of expected generation.b

•

The capacity market is expected to generate £3.8 billion in receipts on average across
the forecast period. This scheme funds payments for reliable sources of capacity, through
generation, storage, and consumer-led flexibility, to meet future peak energy demands
as the UK becomes increasingly reliant on renewable energy sources such as wind and
solar, which have more variable energy generation compared to non-renewable sources.

•

The Government announced in July 2025 that the Sizewell C nuclear power plant will be
financed using a regulated asset base (RAB) model. In the RAB model, levies on electricity
consumers contribute directly to financing costs alongside general government spending.
The RAB levy is expected to generate £1.0 billion in receipts from consumer electricity
bills on average across the forecast period, increasing from £0.3 billion in 2025-26 to
£1.4 billion in 2030-31.

Economic and fiscal outlook

108

Public sector receipts

•

The warm home discount is expected to generate £1.1 billion in receipts on average
across the forecast period, including £0.5 billion to extend eligibility to all households in
receipt of means-tested benefits. Warm home discount receipts increase energy bills for
all consumers to subsidise a £150 discount on bills for selected low-income households.

•

The green gas levy is expected to generate £0.2 billion in receipts on average across the
forecast period. Receipts from consumer gas bills contribute to the costs of the green gas
support scheme, which supports the production of biomethane in the gas grid.

Environmental levies are defined as levies paid by energy consumers with the proceeds used to promote clean energy or other
social goals. We exclude policies that the ONS has yet to classify such as the energy intensive industry support levy, which was
introduced in April 2024.
b
The CfD forecast includes existing CfD auctions up to Allocation Round 6 (AR6). This excludes future auction rounds, including AR7
for which outcomes are expected in early 2026, and is expected to auction CfD contracts up to £1.0 billion a year (in 2025 prices)
between 2028-29 and 2032-33.

4.46

VAT refunds are forecast to raise £30 billion in 2025-26, a 3.6 per cent increase from
2024-25. Receipts then grow over the forecast in line with government consumption,
reaching £36 billion by 2030-31. Relative to our March forecast, receipts are £1.1 billion
lower in 2025-26 due to lower-than-anticipated effective VAT rates on local authority
expenditure. Receipts are then £0.5 billion lower in 2029-30 as a higher path of
government spending partially offsets the lower effective VAT rates assumed. VAT refunds
are offset in receipts and so are neutral for borrowing.

4.47

Interest and dividend receipts are forecast to raise £42 billion in 2025-26, a 0.8 per cent
decline from 2024-25 due to the decline in Bank Rate. Receipts then rise every year
thereafter, largely driven by the interest received from funded public sector pensions and the
109

Public sector receipts

accrued interest on student loans. Relative to March, receipts are higher by £1.2 billion this
year and £1.9 billion on average over the rest of the forecast. This largely reflects the
impact of higher forecast equity prices on funded pensions and the inclusion of the interest
from further public sector financial institutions in the forecast (See Chapter 6 for more
details).
4.48

Council tax is forecast to raise £51 billion in 2025-26, a 7.4 per cent increase on 2024-25.
This is £0.7 billion (1.4 per cent) higher than expected in March, largely driven by stronger
than expected growth in the tax base. Receipts then rise every year thereafter, reaching £67
billion in the final year of the forecast, with council tax bills assumed to generally rise by an
average of 5 per cent a year. As explained in paragraph 3.42 a council tax surcharge for
properties valued over £2 million will be introduced from 2028-29, adding £0.5 billion to
council tax receipts in the final three years of the forecast.

4.49

Gross operating surplus (GOS) is the sum of general government depreciation and public
corporations’ (PCs’) operating surplus. This is forecast to be £83 billion in 2025-26, a 5.7
per cent increase relative to 2024-25. GOS is expected to rise to £97 billion by the end of
our forecast horizon, resulting from increases in the capital stock pushing up depreciation.
Compared to March, GOS is an average of £0.4 billion lower between 2026-27 and 202930, in part reflecting a combination of lower capital expenditure in the Housing Revenue
Account and lower PC operating surplus outturn in 2024-25. General government
depreciation is offset in spending and so is neutral for borrowing.

4.50

Home Office fees are forecast to raise £6 billion in 2025-26, a 14.4 per cent increase on
2024-25. This is mainly due to the April 2025 increase in visa fees announced in Spring
Statement 2025. Relative to our March forecast and prior to the impact of measures,
receipts are £0.6 billion higher in 2029-30, resulting from the continued rollout of
Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) and higher-than-expected visitor receipts boosting visa
fees, as well as higher-than-expected immigration health surcharge receipts. This is partially
offset by a £0.5 billion decrease to visa fees to align with ONS outturns. Policy introduced at
this Budget increases immigration skills charge rates by 32 per cent from 1 October 2025 to
bring rates in line with inflation, but this is offset by higher Home Office spending and
therefore has no impact on borrowing.

Public sector expenditure

Summary of the expenditure forecast
5.1

From its peak during the pandemic of 52.3 per cent of GDP in 2020-21, total public
spending fell to 44.0 per cent of GDP in 2024-25 (Chart 5.1). It is forecast to rise to 45.0
per cent of GDP in 2025-26 and then to fall gradually over the remainder of the forecast to
44.3 per cent of GDP in 2030-31. This would be 5.2 percentage points higher than its prepandemic level in 2019-20.

5.2

As shown in Table 5.1, the change in public spending over the forecast period (2026-27 to
2030-31) is the result of changes in both departmental expenditure limits (DEL), which are
expected to rise until 2027-28 before falling, and annually managed expenditure (AME),
which is expected to peak in 2025-26 before falling:

5.3

•

Departmental expenditure limits are expected to rise as a share of GDP from 20.5 per
cent of GDP in 2024-25 to 21.2 per cent of GDP in 2027-28, and then fall to 20.6
per cent of GDP in 2030-31. The expected fall in the later years of the forecast is
explained by decreases in both day-to-day spending (resource DEL or RDEL) from 17.2
per cent of GDP to 16.8 per cent of GDP between 2027-28 and 2030-31, and in
capital spending (capital DEL or CDEL) which is expected to fall from 4.1 per cent of
GDP in 2027-28 to 3.8 per cent of GDP in 2030-31.

•

Annually managed expenditure is expected to rise as a share of GDP from 23.6 per
cent of GDP in 2024-25 to 23.9 per cent of GDP in 2025-26, and then gradually fall
to 23.7 per cent of GDP by 2030-31. The decline over the forecast period is mainly
driven by time-limited spending items, such as the Infected Blood and Post Office
compensation schemes, which boost other AME spending in the near term, and by a
rising surplus in unfunded public service pension schemes. These declines offset
forecast increases in welfare spending and debt interest.

Relative to the March 2025 forecast (restated for Blue Book 2025 nominal GDP revisions),1
total public spending is expected to be 1.0 per cent of GDP higher in 2029-30 at 44.3 per
cent of GDP. Before the impact of policy measures announced since March 2025, there was
a 0.7 per cent of GDP increase in public spending in 2029-30 due to forecast changes. The
direct and indirect effects of policy measures in this forecast increase spending by a further
0.3 per cent of GDP, mainly driven by a £9 billion (0.3 per cent of GDP) increase in welfare
spending.

Throughout this chapter and this Economic and fiscal outlook (EFO), unless otherwise stated, March 2025 forecast numbers as a per cent
of GDP have been rebased to remove the impact of 2025 Blue Book levels revisions.

Note: Total managed expenditure can be divided into two components of roughly equal size: departmental expenditure limits (DELs)
mostly cover spending on public services, grants and administration ('resource' spending), and investment ('capital' spending). These
items can be planned over multiple years. Annually managed expenditure (AME) covers items less amenable to multi-year planning.

PSNB-neutral spending is defined as general government depreciation, current VAT refunds, and environmental levies. This is
different to the PSNB-neutral receipts total in Table 4.1 because EPR is included within the Resource DEL line, and council tax and CIL
are included within the locally financed expenditure line.

5.4

The spending-to-GDP ratio in 2030-31 is forecast to be 5.2 percentage points above the
pre-pandemic level in 2019-20, but 1.7 percentage points below the post-financial crisis
peak of 46.0 per cent of GDP in 2009-10. Over that period there have been significant
changes in both the level and composition of public spending (Chart 5.2):

Economic and fiscal outlook

112

Public sector expenditure

•

2010-11 to 2019-20: Over this period spending fell by 6.4 per cent of GDP, driven by
policy decisions to reduce day-to-day departmental spending (RDEL) by 3.8 per cent of
GDP, a fall in debt interest spending of 0.8 per cent of GDP, and falls in welfare
spending of 2.1 per cent of GDP, which reflected both policy changes and the
economic recovery from the financial crisis.

•

2020-21 to 2024-25: In the wake of the pandemic, spending spiked upward in 202021 to 13.2 per cent of GDP above 2019-20 levels, driven by the introduction of
temporary pandemic-related income support schemes and loan guarantees, and
higher departmental and welfare spending. By 2024-25, RDEL and welfare spending
had fallen back closer to pre-pandemic levels, but higher CDEL and debt interest
spending meant that overall public spending as a share of GDP was 4.9 percentage
points higher than in 2019-20.

•

2025-26 to 2030-31: Spending is forecast to rise by 1.0 per cent of GDP in 2025-26,
primarily due to higher DEL, welfare and debt interest spending. Over the next five
years, spending is forecast to fall by 0.7 per cent of GDP, mainly reflecting a decline in
RDEL (falling by 0.5 percentage points), and in other spending areas, which mainly
reflects time-limited spending items that are set to come to an end over the next couple
of years, such as the Infected Blood and Post Office compensation schemes, and a
rising surplus in unfunded public service pension schemes. These declines more than
offset a forecast rise in welfare spending (of 0.3 percentage points) and debt interest
(of 0.1 percentage points).

Chart 5.3 shows the change in the level of public spending as a share of GDP between
2019-20 and 2030-31 decomposed into:
•

The spending plans in place at the time of the pre-pandemic Budget in March 2020,
which would have resulted in the spending-to-GDP ratio falling by 0.8 per cent of GDP
over this period.

•

Underlying forecast revisions, which raise spending by 3.0 per cent of GDP relative to
pre-pandemic expectations. These are driven mainly by higher debt interest spending,
due to upward revisions to the amount of debt and the cost of servicing it, and to
welfare spending, due to higher inflation and higher health-related caseloads.

•

Discretionary spending measures announced by previous governments would have
raised the spending-to-GDP ratio by 0.7 percentage points, reflecting net increases to
RDEL and CDEL spending.

•

Discretionary spending measures announced by the current government are expected
to raise spending by 2.2 per cent of GDP in 2030-31, mostly from higher RDEL and
CDEL spending.

Changes in spending since the March 2025 forecast
5.6

Relative to the March 2025 forecast, spending in cash terms is forecast to be £23 billion
higher in 2025-26, reflecting upwards revisions including to departmental spending (£3.9
billion), welfare spending (£7 billion), local authority spending (£6 billion), and debt interest
spending (£2.4 billion) due to higher gilt yields. The ONS has also revised up its initial
estimate of total public spending in 2024-25 by £2.4 billion since its initial estimate in April
2025, including a £3.4 billion upward revision to local authority spending.

Economic and fiscal outlook

Public sector expenditure

5.7

Relative to the March 2025 forecast, spending in cash terms is forecast to be around £32
billion a year higher in 2029-30 (Table 5.2):
•

Changes to the pre-measures forecast have increased spending by around £20 billion
in 2029-30. The principal differences have been upwards revisions to welfare
spending of £8 billion a year due to higher inflation and disability caseloads, increases
to local authority spending of around £6 billion a year reflecting revisions to recent
outturn and higher forecast spending on special educational needs and disabilities
(SEND), higher departmental spending of £1.5 billion a year,2 and higher debt interest
payments, mainly due to higher gilt yields, of £3.6 billion a year.

•

Fiscally neutral spending,3 which is offset in receipts, increases spending by £2.2
billion in 2029-30. This is largely driven by higher public sector depreciation due to
upward revisions to the size of the capital stock, and higher council tax receipts. This is
partly offset by the increase in spending on VAT refunds.

•

Policies announced since the March 2025 forecast and in Autumn Budget 2025 are
expected to increase spending by £11 billion in 2029-30. The Government’s welfare
policy reversals and the removal of the two-child limit on benefits account for £9
billion of that increase. Other major spending policy increases include £1.6 billion
higher CDEL spending and the expansion of the warm home discount (£0.6 billion),
partially offset by a £0.8 billion reduction to RDEL.

•

The indirect effects of the Government’s policy package are expected to increase
spending by £1.2 billion in 2029-30. This increase includes £1.4 billion higher debt
interest payments due to a higher central government net cash requirement, partially
offset by a £0.6 billion decrease to welfare spending due to lower inflation reducing
benefit uprating.

•

SEND-related spending judgements reduce spending by £2.2 billion in 2029-30. The
Government has announced in the Budget that SEND provision will be fully absorbed
into existing RDEL limits from 2028-29. As a result, we assume that departments will
not underspend against budgets in that year, which increases 2028-29 spending by
£1.9 billion. This also removes some financial pressure from local authorities and so
we have assumed that in response they make less use of reserves and borrow slightly
more for capital investments. As a result, alongside other measures, local authority net
borrowing is £2.2 billion lower by 2029-30 compared to the pre-measures forecast.
These changes are explained in more detail in Box 5.1 and paragraph 5.20.

2

This largely reflects that our judgement that departments will underspend against their budgets in the Spending Review period by less
than was previously assumed by the Treasury, which therefore increases forecast total spending. See paragraph 5.20 for a more detailed
description.
3
This includes environmental levies (including warm homes discount), VAT refunds, depreciation, extended producer responsibility,
community infrastructure levy, and council tax.

Analysis of spending by category
Spending within departmental expenditure limits
5.8

Spending subject to departmental expenditure limits (DEL) makes up 47 per cent of all
public spending and is divided into a set of nominal limits for each of 18 government
departments that are set at Spending Reviews. Spending plans for 2025-26 were set at
Autumn Budget 2024. The June 2025 Spending Review then set plans for 2026-27 to
2028-29 for RDEL spending and 2026-27 to 2029-30 for CDEL spending. In this section,
‘RDEL spending’ refers to departmental resource, or day-to-day, spending, and ‘CDEL
spending’ refers to departmental capital, or investment, spending.4

4

More formally, unless otherwise stated these terms refer, respectively, to public sector current expenditure (PSCE) in RDEL and public
sector gross investment (PSGI) in CDEL, which is the spending within DELs that is recorded within the National Accounts measure of total
managed expenditure.

5.9

Total departmental spending is forecast to rise by £124 billion between 2024-25 and 202930, as set out in Table 5.3, of which current spending increases by £98 billion and capital
spending by £26 billion. Compared to the March 2025 forecast, and excluding fiscally
neutral classification changes, total departmental spending is £35.5 billion higher over the
forecast period. Within this RDEL is higher by between £3.3 and £6.4 billion in the years
covered by the Spending Review due to policy changes and our underspend adjustments,
which are described in detail below. In 2029-30, after the Spending Review period, RDEL
spending is reduced by £0.5 billion. CDEL is higher in all years by between £2.3 and £5.6
billion.

5.10

The path of real-terms spending over the forecast is also set out in Table 5.3. Real growth
peaks in 2025-26 at 4.3 per cent, then falls to just under 2 per cent in 2026-27 and 202728, declines further to 0.3 per cent in 2028-29 and falls by 0.2 per cent in 2029-30, before
rising again to 1.3 per cent in 2030-31. Relative to our March forecast:
•

Real-terms RDEL spending growth is 0.4 percentage points higher in 2025-26
compared to our March forecast, at 4.0 per cent. Spending growth is then,
cumulatively, relatively unchanged from 2026-27 to 2028-29 with an increase of 1.2
per cent a year on average. RDEL is then held flat in 2029-30, below the 1.0 per cent
real-terms rise in our March forecast.

•

Real-terms CDEL growth follows an uneven path, with growth of 5.7 per cent in 202526, 2.0 per cent in 2026-27, 6.2 per cent in 2027-28, then falling in real terms in
2028-29 and 2029-30, by 2.2 and 0.9 per cent, respectively, before rising again in
2030-31. Changes since March have not materially changed the shape of this path.

Table 5.4 shows the breakdown of changes to DEL spending since March. The details of
policy changes are discussed in detail in later sections. The government has made a
number of fiscally neutral reclassifications across DEL and AME which in 2029-30 increase
RDEL by £45.8 billion and CDEL by £3.6 billion. The largest is the reclassification of the
Scottish block grant from AME to DEL, increasing RDEL by £46.2 billion and CDEL by £7.4
billion in 2029-30. Others include reclassifying Sizewell C from CDEL to capital AME (a
£2.6 billion decrease to CDEL in 2029-30), moving Scottish police and fire public service
pensions to resource AME (a £0.4 billion decrease to RDEL in 2029-30), and reclassifying
the Greater London Authority’s business rates retention to local authorities (a £1.2 billion
decrease to total CDEL in 2029-30). Support to Ukraine is reclassified from CDEL to a
financial transaction, reducing CDEL by £0.8 billion in 2025-26 and 2026-27.5

In the rest of this chapter, we present ‘reclassified’ March 2025 forecasts which includes these fiscally neutral changes to make
comparisons with this November 2025 forecast.

Departmental spending allocations in 2025-26
5.12

RDEL is now estimated to be £525 billion in 2025-26, a £3.3 billion increase on the
reclassified March 2025 forecast. This reflects a decrease in our estimate of the amount by
which departments will underspend against plans (£2.4 billion), higher spending funded by
tax receipts (£1.0 billion),6 and policy changes made by the Government (£0.3 billion),
partially offset by updated departmental plans at Main estimates (a £0.7 billion reduction).

5.13

We have reduced our estimate of overall underspending against RDEL plans this year by
£2.4 billion compared to the March forecast, from £6.4 billion to £4.0 billion. Departments
spent around 50 per cent of their allocation in the first six months of the year, which is in
line with usual spending patterns, but our assessment is that in-year spending pressures
have increased since the March forecast.

5.14

CDEL is now estimated to be £118 billion in 2025-26, a £0.5 billion increase on the
reclassified March 2025 forecast. This reflects a small decrease in our estimate of the
amount by which departments will underspend against plans (£0.2 billion), updated
departmental plans at Main estimates (£0.2 billion), and policy decisions to increase
spending (£0.1 billion).

Departmental spending allocations during the Spending Review period
5.15

RDEL spending on the Treasury’s definition rises to £537 billion in 2026-27 and then to
£566 billion by 2028-29, the last year of the Spending Review period for RDEL.7 The fastestgrowing allocations among the large departments are Health and Social Care, Work and
Pensions, and Justice growing respectively at 2.4, 2.2 and 1.2 per cent a year in real terms
on average (see Table 5.5), while other departments’ budgets are broadly flat or falling in
real terms over the Spending Review.

5.16

Table 5.5 shows the RDEL allocations to the largest departments. These have been updated
since the Spending Review following the policy changes made in this Budget. The table
excludes any assumptions about underspends.

6

The ONS classifies several fees within the Treasury’s definition of ‘RDEL ex’ as receipts: notably visa fees, the immigration health
surcharge, and the extended producer levy. We incorporate changes in PSCE in RDEL spending financed by fees the ONS classifies as
receipts as pre-measures changes. These are fiscally neutral as changes in fee income are reflected in our receipts forecast and directly
offset by changes in PSCE in RDEL spending.
7
The Treasury allocates spending limits to departments on an ‘RDEL excluding depreciation’ basis, which is a broader definition of
spending than PSCE in RDEL and incorporates some items which are not included in the National Accounts definition of spending.

5.17

Relative to the reclassified March forecast, RDEL is £6 billion higher on average between
2026-27 and 2028-29. Policy changes announced at the 2025 Spending Review and at the
Budget increase RDEL by £0.9 billion on average per year. As the Spending Review limits
have now been set, we have made an assessment of the level of underspend against those
limits following an assessment of the spending pressures that is set out in the next section.
This level was lower than anticipated by the Treasury when the indicative spending totals
were set in March, resulting in an average increase in spending of £5.1 billion per year.

5.18

Relative to the reclassified March forecast, CDEL is £3.6 billion higher on average over the
Spending Review years. At the 2025 Spending Review, CDEL was increased by £4.6 billion
in 2026-27, £0.2 billion in 2027-28, and decreased by £0.2 billion in 2028-29 and £0.7
billion in 2029-30. Policy decisions in the Budget increase capital spending by £1.1 billion a
year on average. Offsetting these increases, we have assumed that departments will
underspend capital budgets by £5.3 billion a year on average, smaller than that assumed
by the Treasury, as explained further below.

Pressures in the Spending Review period
5.19

There are already several significant new or growing pressures on the departmental
spending limits set in the 2025 Spending Review,8,9 including from:
•

Higher inflation: When the Spending Review envelopes were set at March 2025,
cumulative inflation between 2025-26 and 2028-29 was expected to be 5.7 per cent,
our central forecast is now for 6.3 per cent. Before policy decisions, this reduced
average annual real growth in total DEL budgets over the Spending Review years by
0.1 per cent. After policy decisions to increase RDEL and CDEL, average annual real

8

Unlike the other parts of departmental spending chapter, the pressures described in 5.19 are reported on the Treasury’s definitions of
RDEL excluding depreciation and CDEL spending, which are broader definitions of spending than PSCE in RDEL and PSGI in CDEL. CDEL
includes financial transactions and RDEL incorporates some items which are not included in the National Accounts definition of spending.
9
This list of pressures does not include an additional £0.6 billion reserve pressure over the Spending Review period (equivalent to 12 per
cent of the RDEL reserve). This pressure emerged after we closed our forecast which meant we were unable to assess the implications for
our underspend or overspend assumptions. It therefore represents an upside risk to spending which we will incorporate into our next
forecast.

121

Economic and fiscal outlook

Public sector expenditure

growth rates in total DEL budgets are now 0.1 per cent higher than planned in March
2025.

5.20

•

Special educational needs and disabilities: As set out in more detail in Box 5.1, the
Government has announced that from 2028-29 the cost of SEND provision will be
fully absorbed within the existing RDEL envelope. The Government has not set out any
specific plans on how this pressure, which we estimate at £6 billion in 2028-29, would
be accommodated within the existing RDEL envelope. If it were fully funded within the
Department for Education’s £69 billion RDEL core schools budget in 2028-29, this
would imply a 1.7 per cent real fall in mainstream school spending per pupil rather
than the 2.4 per cent increase planned by Government. The Government has stated
that it will set out proposed reforms to SEND provision early in the new year.

•

Spending on asylum accommodation: The Home Office Spending Review settlement
was made on the basis that the Home Office would fully stop the use of hotels for
asylum-seekers in this Parliament, and asylum spending would be £1.1 billion lower at
£2.5 billion in 2028-29 compared to 2025-26 plans. So far this year, the number of
migrants arriving by small boat and asylum seekers in supported accommodation has
risen by 19 and 8 per cent, respectively, compared to last year. If spending on asylum
remained at its 2024-25 level, this would imply £1.4 billion of additional pressure on
the Home Office budget by 2028-29.

•

Pressures on the Department for Health and Social Care’s budget: The July and
November five-day resident doctors’ strikes are estimated to have cost £0.5 billion,
and there is a risk of further strikes. In addition to this, there is a risk of higher
spending on drugs depending on the outcome of negotiations over branded
medicines. The Spending Review assumed that spending on branded medicines
(around 7 per cent of NHS RDEL) would rise by 25 per cent (£3.3 billion) between
2025-26 and 2028-29. A 5 per cent larger rise in spending on branded medicines
over the Spending Review would cost £0.7 billion by 2028-29.

•

The implementation of digital ID cards is provisionally forecast to cost £1.8 billion in
total over the next three years, split across £0.5 billion RDEL and £1.3 billion CDEL.
The Government has announced its intention to meet the costs of this through existing
DEL budgets, however no specific savings have yet been identified.

We have taken account of these pressures in assessing by how much departments are likely
to underspend or overspend against plans in the Spending Review period. We estimate that
departments will:
•

Underspend their resource budgets by an average £1.8 billion (0.3 per cent) in the
first two years of the Spending Review. This would be £1.0 billion smaller than the prepandemic average underspend reflecting the additional pressures set out above. In
2028-29, we estimate that departments will have zero underspend on their resource
budgets. This reflects the substantial pressure in this year from absorbing the cost of
SEND provision, for which the Government has not specified a funding plan, as well

as the Treasury’s decision in this Budget to reduce RDEL spending in this year by £1.4
billion from previously announced plans at the June 2025 Spending Review. The
implementation of these reductions in departmental spending is a notable risk to our
forecast. The Government will reconsider 2028-29 departmental resource budgets at
the 2027 Spending Review. On average, governments since 1998 have delivered 0.7
per cent faster annual real growth in day-to-day spending in the final year of a
Spending Review than originally planned, which would be equivalent to £4.7 billion in
2028-29.10
•

Underspend their capital budgets by £9.7 billion (7.2 per cent) in 2026-27, when
CDEL grows 2.9 per cent in real terms, and by an average £3.7 billion (2.7 per cent)
thereafter when CDEL falls in real terms. We have assumed a historically higher
underspend in 2026-27 based on past evidence that departmental capital budgets are
underspent by large margins in years when capital budgets are increased sharply.11
We have smaller-than-average underspends in each year between 2027-28 and
2029-30, in anticipation that the large underspend in 2026-27 will be offset by higher
spending in the remaining years of the Spending Review.

Departmental spending after the Spending Review period
5.21

5.22

For the years after the current Spending Review period, the Government has not allocated
DEL budgets to departments. These are expected to be set at the next Spending Review in
2027. Instead, the Government provides an assumption for total resource and capital
spending over this period. These estimates are currently:12
•

Total resource spending is assumed to be £589 billion in 2029-30 and £609 billion in
2030-31, implying average annual real-terms growth of 0.7 per cent. On average,
real-terms growth in these two years is 0.5 percentage points lower than the years of
the Spending Review. Compared to the March 2025 forecast, real growth in 2029-30
is 1.0 percentage points lower.

•

Total capital spending is assumed to be £137 billion in 2030-31, implying annual
real-terms growth of 0.9 per cent, 0.4 percentage points slower than over the
Spending Review period.

To illustrate the spending implications of these assumed envelopes, we consider what policy
commitments in certain areas of spending imply for growth in spending in areas not
covered by commitments, often called ‘unprotected’ spending. For RDEL spending, we
assume the following:

10

This average excludes the 2019 Spending Review on the basis that the final year of that Spending Review was 2020-21and therefore
had large real growth owing to temporary pandemic schemes.
11
See Box 3.2 of the March 2020 EFO.
12
The changes to post Spending Review growth rates described in this section reflect the offsetting impact of Treasury changes to the
assumptions they set for total resource spending in this period, and Treasury changes to their provisional assumptions for departmental
underspend in this period, shown in Table 5.4. As set out in the November 2023 EFO, we do not set underspend assumptions for years
outside of spending reviews given no departmental spending allocations or policy objectives are set for these periods. In March 2025, the
Treasury assumed a provisional RDEL underspend of £6.3 billion in 2029-30, which it has now reduced to £3.3 billion. For CDEL, the
Treasury has assumed a provisional underspend of £4.0 billion in 2030-31, down from the £7.2 billion it assumed in March.

123

Public sector expenditure

5.23

•

Spending on the NHS grows at 2.6 per cent a year in real terms after 2028-29 in line
with growth rates set at the 2025 Spending Review.

•

The Government’s commitment to reach 3 per cent of GDP spending on defence by
2035 means Ministry of Defence DEL spending rises from 2.0 per cent in 2025-26 to
2.7 per cent by the end of the forecast, based on a linear path to 3 per cent in 2035.

•

Spending on Official Development Assistance (ODA) grows in line with gross national
income (GNI) after 2028-29, in line with the Government’s commitment to spend 0.3
per cent of GNI on ODA by 2027.

•

Spending on SEND (high needs) grows by 0.4 per cent in real terms a year reflecting
the Treasury’s stated assumption, and which also includes the cost of DSG deficits from
2028-29 onwards.

•

Spending on the remaining core schools budget is held flat per pupil in real terms as a
policy-neutral baseline.

Within the assumed envelope for total RDEL spending provided by the Treasury, these
assumptions would leave other ‘unprotected’ RDEL spending (accounting for just under a
third of day-to-day departmental spending) falling by 3.3 per cent a year in real terms in
the final two years of the forecast (Chart 5.5). Spending would have to be £21 billion higher
in 2030-31 not to fall in real terms from 2028-29. As outlined in Box 4.2 in the March
2024 Economic and fiscal outlook (EFO), as Spending Reviews have approached,
governments have on average increased the annual real growth in resource spending by an
average 1.1 per cent, equivalent to £6 billion in 2025-26.

Table 5.6 splits resource departmental spending into economic categories. Since the March
2025 forecast, the Treasury has supplied the OBR with indicative assumptions about general
government (central government and local government) pay and departmental pay
envelopes. These assumptions are that general government wage growth is a weighted
average of public sector pay recommendations in 2025-26, and then general government
wages grow in line with private sector wages in 2026-27 and beyond. This assumes a
significant slowdown in central government pay growth from 6.1 per cent this year to 3.2
per cent next year before setting at just over 2 per cent from 2027-28 onwards.

Local authority expenditure and borrowing
5.25

Compared to March 2025, our forecast for the level of borrowing by local authorities (LAs)
has increased markedly. The ONS now estimates that in the three years from 2022-23 to
2024-25, LAs borrowed a total of £43 billion, which the ONS has revised up from the £32
billion estimated at the time of the March forecast. LAs have financed this borrowing partly
through increased borrowing from central government (£12 billion), and partly from
running down liquid financial assets (£10 billion) with the remaining borrowing largely from
commercial lenders. Provisional in-year data for 2025-26 suggests that these higher levels
of borrowing will persist into this year. As a result, we have significantly increased our
forecast for 2025-26 LA borrowing to £16 billion, compared to £6 billion in March.

These high levels of borrowing are, in part, a reflection of the growing financial pressures
which have resulted in an increasing number of LAs in England being granted ‘exceptional
financial support’ (EFS).13 In 2017-18, one LA required EFS at the cost of £0.1 billion. By
2025-26, this had risen to 29 LAs receiving a total of £1.3 billion in support. As highlighted
in our March 2025 EFO and July 2025 Fiscal risks and sustainability report, a particularly
significant and growing source of pressure on LA budgets is spending on SEND, which is
discussed in detail in Box 5.1.

Box 5.1: Local authority spending on special educational needs and disabilities
Local authorities receive a ring-fenced grant from the Department for Education (DfE) to pay for
mainstream and special needs education for children and young people – the dedicated schools
grant or DSG. The 2014 Children and Families Act expanded the statutory obligations of local
authorities towards children and young people with special educational needs and disabilities
(SEND). Under the Act, local authorities were given a statutory obligation to assess whether
children and young people have a special educational need or disability; require an education,
health and care plan (EHCP) to address that need or disability; secure educational provision
according to these plans; and provide recipients of EHCPs with suitable education placements in
either a mainstream or special education school.
Between 2016 and 2025, the number of children and young people with an EHCP has more
than doubled from 256,000 to 639,000, and risen from under 3 per cent to over 5 per cent of
all pupils.a This has significantly increased cost pressures on local authorities, with the result that
the DSG has been insufficient to cover SEND spending since 2020. In 2020, the Government
introduced a temporary ‘statutory override’ allowing local authorities to ignore SEND spending

13

This is a government support mechanism to allow financially distressed LAs to use revenue from asset sales or borrow from the Public
Works Loan Board (PWLB) lending facility for current spending.

Economic and fiscal outlook

above the DSG grant (the DSG deficit) for the purpose of recording a balanced budget. The
override was initially set to expire in April 2023 but was then extended in January 2023 to April
2026. These DSG deficits have steadily increased from £0.2 billion in 2020-21 to an estimated
£2.5 billion in 2025-26 (Chart A).
The statutory override has masked, but not resolved, the pressures on local authority finances
from SEND spending. While the override makes it easier for local authorities to meet their legal
requirement to run a balanced budget, they must still finance costs that exceed the grant through
additional borrowing, the use of un-ring-fenced reserves, or a reduction in spending on other
non-statutory services. Partly because of SEND pressures, local authorities’ liquid assets have
fallen from £35 billion in 2020-21 to £22 billion in 2024-25. The stock of local authority debt
via the Public Works Loan Board and other mechanisms has also increased from £120 billion in
2021-22 to £136 billion in 2024-25. In October 2024, the National Audit Office (NAO)
estimated that, without the statutory override, 43 per cent of local authorities would be at risk of
issuing a Section 114 report, indicating that the local authority is unable to balance its budget.b
In June 2025, the Government extended the statutory override by a further two years to April
2028. DSG deficits are now forecast to rise further in these two years and reach £4.9 billion in
2027-28 (Chart A), with the cumulative DSG deficits accumulated by LAs forecast to reach £14
billion by the end of the new override period, equivalent to around two-thirds of the total liquid
assets local authorities held in 2024-25.

The Government has announced at this Budget that all SEND spending from 2028-29 will be
absorbed within existing RDEL limits, though it has not specified how this will be achieved. Chart
A shows that, based on current SEND policy, this pressure is forecast to reach £9 billion by
2030-31.c We discuss the implications of absorbing this significant pressure into central
government DEL in paragraph 5.20 above. The Government has stated that it will publish a
white paper early in the new year setting out reforms to the SEND system.

127

Economic and fiscal outlook

This would mean that LAs would not build up further DSG deficits from 2028-29. However,
based on current policy, LAs would then be required to recognise the historic DSG deficits, which
are expected to reach £14 billion, on their balance sheets. This would be very likely to result in
many local authorities issuing Section 114s, due to being unable to set a balanced budget. The
fiscal impact of this would depend on how central government and individual LAs respond. The
Government has not set out how it will address this issue other than to state that its policy
position is to work with local authorities to manage their SEND deficits and that it will set out
more detail at the provisional Local Government Finance Settlement in December 2025.

NAO, Local government financial sustainability, February 2025.
.c We estimate the size of the SEND pressure as the difference between the spending we estimate required to meet SEND pressures
(which we estimate will grow by 9 per cent a year) against a counterfactual where high-needs funding rises in line with the core
schools budget (0.4 per cent real annual growth).
b

5.27

We forecast that LA net borrowing in 2026-27 and 2027-28 will remain at relatively
elevated levels, averaging £12 billion per year, which is £9 billion higher than expected in
March (Table 5.7). LA borrowing is then forecast to fall to around £8 billion in the final
three years of the forecast, around £5 billion higher in 2029-30 than forecast in March.
This reflects:
•

The Government’s extension of the DSG statutory override to 31 March 2028,
described in Box 5.1, increases LA borrowing due to SEND deficits by an estimated
£3.7 billion in 2026-27 and £4.9 billion in 2027-28.14 From 2028-29, LA borrowing
is then reduced due to the Government’s announcement that all SEND spending will
be absorbed within the existing RDEL envelope. The implications of this for the DEL
spending forecast is explained in paragraph 5.20.

•

We assume that local authorities’ net capital spending will fall slightly over the next
three years. We then assume capital spending increases gradually after 2028-29 as
SEND spending being absorbed by central government relieves some pressure on
local authority finances.

•

We also assume that net current spending falls sharply after this year. This reflects
pressures on current spending created by the increase in SEND costs and a fall in
spending related to the EFS currently in place for 29 LAs. Reflecting current policy, the
forecast currently assumes there is no EFS in place after this year, as EFS is only
announced on an annual basis in early February.

14

The March 2025 forecast did not include the cost of SEND deficits in 2026-27 and 2027-28 because at that point the Government had
not announced the extension of the statutory override and the significant upward pressure that SEND provision was placing on LA
borrowing was not clear in the outturn data.

5.29

The LA spending and borrowing forecast is subject to particular uncertainty because of:
•

Recent substantial revisions to LA borrowing estimates and outturns, which reflect
ongoing challenges in obtaining timely and high-quality estimates particularly for
expenditure by local authorities. The ONS, the Ministry of Housing, Communities and
Local Government, the Treasury and the OBR have formed a joint Local Government
Financial Information Taskforce to investigate and address these concerns, with the
overall objective of improving the flow of data to the ONS and the accuracy of our
forecast.

•

The estimated £14 billion stock of cumulative DSG deficits which, as set out in Box 5.1,
will be recognised on LA balance sheets at the end of the current statutory override
period in 2028-29. This represents a significant fiscal risk to the forecast and an
insolvency risk to the sector.

•

More generally, increased use of EFS represents a wider risk to the forecast, as it is
only announced by Government for one year ahead in February each year, and
therefore no estimate is included for future years in this forecast. Its cost has grown
from £0.1 billion in 2017-18 to £1.3 billion in 2025-26.

LAs face several other financial risks related to the cost of housing, statutory services, and
uncertainty over future revenue. Key risks include:
•

The housing and revenue account (HRA) becoming unprofitable as growth in spending
(a cumulative 90 per cent between 2019-20 and 2024-25), driven by rising safety and
maintenance costs in the sector, have outpaced growth in revenues (a cumulative 8 per

129

Economic and fiscal outlook

Public sector expenditure

cent between 2019-20 and 2024-25) which have not kept up with rising costs due to
restrictions on social housing rent increases.15
•

Increasing demand for temporary accommodation, pushing up the cost of temporary
accommodation for LAs who saw the cost of housing services (excluding the HRA) rise
by an average of 20 per cent a year between 2022-23 and 2024-25. This compares
to 8 per cent annual growth in the cost of housing services in the five years up to
2022-23. Total costs are likely to continue to rise if asylum backlogs fall and some
refugees move from central government funded asylum accommodation to
accommodation provided by local authorities. Demand for asylum accommodation
has also grown and is now expected to cost £15.3 billion over the next 10 years,
revised up from the Home Office’s previous estimate of £4.5 billion.16

•

Uncertainty surrounding the Fair Funding Review 2.0, which will see a redistribution of
central grant income towards LAs with higher assessed spending needs and lower
local resources. This will therefore see LAs with lower assessed spending needs but
higher local resources receiving less in grants.

Public corporations
5.30

Public corporations (PC) own capital spending in 2029-30 is expected to be £0.7 billion
lower than in our March 2025 forecast, reaching £15 billion by 2030-31. This is driven by
a combination of new outturn data, modelling updates, and changes to our forecast for LA
net capital spending relative to March, particularly in the final three years of our forecast.

Welfare spending
5.31

Total welfare spending in the forecast refers to AME spending on social security and tax
credits. Around half is subject to the Government’s ‘welfare cap’, which excludes the state
pension and those payments most sensitive to the economic cycle (we discuss performance
against the cap in Chapter 7). The welfare spending forecasts are based on the
determinants in the latest economy forecast – principally population, unemployment,
earnings, and inflation – and informed by the latest outturn data and Department for Work
and Pensions (DWP) models.

5.32

Welfare spending is forecast to rise this year by £18 billion (5.8 per cent) to £333 billion or
10.9 per cent of GDP (Table 5.8). It is then forecast to rise in nominal terms by an average
of £11 billion (2.9 per cent) a year over the rest of the forecast period, reaching £406
billion or 11.2 per cent of GDP in 2030-31. This would be 1.1 per cent of GDP higher than
its pre-pandemic level of 10.1 per cent of GDP in 2019-20.

15

The HRA is a ring-fenced financial account used by local authorities to record all income and expenditure related to the provision and
management of their own social housing stock. It ensures that LA housing revenue income is reinvested solely into maintaining,
managing, and building council housing, keeping it separate from the council's main budget.

Economic and fiscal outlook

130

Public sector expenditure

5.33

The increase in welfare spending as a share of GDP is mainly driven by rising spending on
health and disability benefits and pensioner spending (Chart 5.7). This offsets a fall in other
welfare spending as a share of GDP which is primarily due to the assumption that most
benefits rise by CPI. The increase in spending on pensions is due to the impact of the triple
lock, which is offset between 2026 and 2028 by the rise in the state pension age from 66 to
67. Medium-term and long-term trends in spending on the state pension are examined in
detail in our 2025 Fiscal risks and sustainability report.

5.34

The increase in spending on health and disability benefits is underpinned by an assumption
that the sharp increase in caseloads seen over recent years will continue, but with the rate of
growth slowing from this year onwards. The latest data suggests that this assumption,
though highly uncertain, continues to look reasonable:
•

The judgement that underlying adult disability benefit demand will fall back halfway to
pre-pandemic rates as cost-of-living pressures ease appears to be bearing out in
outturn. Monthly new claims for personal independence payment (PIP) have begun to
fall for the first time since the pandemic, averaging 72,000 between January and July
this year compared to 78,000 in the same period last year, though still remain 78 per
cent higher than pre-pandemic levels. Attendance allowance claims, while remaining
high, also show signs of a slowdown, with the latest six months of new claims outturn
(December 2024 to May 2025) now only 34 per cent above the pre-pandemic trend,
compared to 49 per cent above in the previous six months (June to November 2024).

•

The incapacity benefit caseload has seen substantial growth following the managed
migration of non-health-related legacy cases to universal credit (UC), though this is a
one-off effect that will not affect the medium-term trend. A very large number of nonhealth-related migrations between September 2023 and February 2025 (112,000, or
23 per cent of non-health-related migrations in that period) have subsequently
reported a restricted ability to work and joined the UC health caseload, increasing
health-related spending by roughly £0.9 billion in 2025-26.17 Given the migration of
non-health-related cases is now complete, we do not expect further incapacity onflows
for this reason in the forecast.

17

Health-related spending here refers to standard allowance and health element spending for claimants on the UC health caseload and
excludes other elements. Just over half of this increase is offset by lower non-health-related spending elsewhere in UC.

Relative to the March 2025 forecast, welfare spending is expected to be higher across the
forecast with the difference reaching £16 billion by 2029-30. Table 5.9 shows that this
revision is driven by:
•

Higher benefit uprating, which increases spending by £3.1 billion in 2029-30. Roughly
half (£1.6 billion) is explained by higher CPI uprating for working-age benefits, with
the rest mostly due to higher earnings increasing triple lock uprating for pensions
(£1.4 billion).

•

Higher unemployment in the first half of the forecast period, which increases universal
credit spending by £1.8 and £1.2 billion in 2026-27 and 2027-28, before tapering
off to a £0.5 billion increase in 2029-30.

•

Higher disability caseloads and average awards, which increase spending by £1.4
billion in 2029-30. Most of this is driven by lower exit rates from PIP and attendance
allowance (£0.9 billion), which the latest DWP data shows have fallen substantially
since the onset of the pandemic.

•

Higher pensioner awards and caseloads, which increase spending by £1.5 billion in
2029-30. The rise is mainly explained by updating the state pension model with postCovid base data, which shows higher-than-expected new state pension awards.

•

Policy measures, which increase spending by £9 billion in 2029-30. These include the
reversal of the tightened gateway for PIP at Spring Statement 2025 and the extension
of winter fuel payment eligibility announced in the summer, which increase spending
by £4.0 billion and £1.7 billion respectively.18 They also include the removal of the

Debt interest spending
5.36

Debt interest spending as a share of GDP is forecast to rise from 3.7 per cent of GDP in
2025-26 to 3.9 per cent of GDP in 2030-31. Compared to the March 2025 forecast, debt
interest spending is broadly unchanged as a share of GDP and as a share of total revenue.
This primarily reflects higher interest rates offset by lower cash borrowing across the forecast
period. Spending on debt interest remains at its highest level since the 1980s and is also
close to the highest levels on record both as a share of GDP and government revenue.

Economic and fiscal outlook

Public sector expenditure

5.37

In nominal terms, debt interest spending is forecast to rise in every year from £114 billion in
2025-26 to £140 billion by 2030-31. Compared to the March 2025 forecast, debt interest
spending is £5 billion higher in 2029-30, reflecting stronger RPI inflation in the short term
and higher interest rates on a rising stock of debt in the medium term:
•

Bank rate and gilt rates are expected to increase debt interest costs compared to the
March 2025 forecast by £0.5 billion in 2025-26 and by £3.3 billion in 2029-30. The
increased proportion of short-term gilts in the Government’s debt portfolio means that
debt interest costs have been less sensitive to the recent steepening of the UK gilt curve,
where 30-year gilts have risen by 33 basis points since March while five-year gilt yields
have fallen by 7 basis points. (Chapter 6 examines the impact on debt interest costs of
the changing maturity composition of gilt issuance in more detail).

•

Revisions to the RPI inflation forecast increases spending by £6 billion in 2026-27 and
by smaller amounts thereafter.

•

Financing and other factors are expected to increase debt interest spending by £1.7
billion in 2025-26 and to reduce spending in the medium term. This reflects higherthan-forecast outturn data in 2025-26, which is then offset in each year from 2026-27
onwards by a lower pre-measures net financing requirement (Chapter 6 examines the
financing forecast in further detail).

•

The effects of policy result in a £1.4 billion increase in debt interest by 2029-30, due
to the £33 billion cumulative increase in central government cash borrowing at the
front end of the forecast period, slightly offset by tightening from 2029-30. Mainly
driven by a fall in RPI inflation, policy measures reduce spending on debt interest by
£2.7 billion in 2026-27.

Economic and fiscal outlook

Public sector expenditure

PSNB-neutral spending and other annually managed expenditure
5.38

5.39

Fiscally neutral spending includes spending which is offset in receipts and therefore does not
affect public sector net borrowing.19 Fiscally neutral spending has increased by £4.3 billion
in 2029-30 since the March 2025 forecast, with the main changes including:
•

Public sector depreciation, which is £0.9 billion lower in 2025-26 compared to our
March forecast, but £2.1 billion higher in 2029-30. This is driven by reductions in the
general government capital stock and downward revisions to depreciation outturn,
followed by upward revisions to PC depreciation outturn and the capital stock.

•

Council tax, which is £0.7 billion higher in 2025-26, increasing to £1.3 billion higher
in 2029-30. This is due to stronger-than-expected growth in the tax base, and the
assumption of council tax bills rising by an average of 5 per cent per year.

•

Environmental levies, where spending is £1.7 billion higher in 2025-26 than expected
in March, and £1.0 billion higher in 2029-30. This is mainly due to an increase in the
cost of contracts for difference. Environmental levies are explained further in Box 4.2.

•

Current VAT refunds, which are £1.4 billion lower in 2029-30 due to lower-thananticipated effective VAT rates on local authority expenditure that is partly offset by a
higher path of government spending.

There are many other items of AME spending included in the forecast, which overall are
expected to decline from £75 billion or 2.5 per cent of GDP in 2025-26, to £71 billion or 2
per cent of GDP in 2030-31. The main drivers of this forecast decline include:
•

Time-limited spending items, including compensation schemes and business rates
transitional relief, which increase spending in the early years of the forecast period, but
contribute to the decline in AME spending as they come to an end. The total cost of the
Post Office redress scheme and the Infected Blood Compensation Scheme is expected
to fall from £3.7 billion in 2025-26 to £0.1 billion in 2030-31 in line with the fall in
caseload each year. Measures relating to business rates transitional relief increase net
spending in 2026-27 to 2028-29 by around £0.9 billion, before ending in 2028-29.20

•

The surplus on unfunded public service pensions, which is expected to rise from a £0.3
billion surplus in 2025-26 to a £3.8 billion surplus in 2030-31. This is due to forecast
growth in the public sector paybill boosting scheme receipts more quickly than the
growth in scheme expenditure, which has been linked to CPI inflation since 2011-12.
This continues a longer-term trend, where the net cost of unfunded pensions fell from
a £5.7 billion deficit in 2010-11 to a £0.8 deficit in 2024-25, driven by public sector
pay rises and an increase in the number of public sector employees. Compared to our
March forecast, net public service pension spending is £0.7 billion higher on average
in 2029-30 as a result of higher CPI inflation increasing expenditure.

19

This includes environmental levies (including warm homes discount), VAT refunds, depreciation, extended producer responsibility,
community infrastructure levy, and council tax.
20
Business rates transitional relief package includes the transitional relief measure, the transitional relief supplement measure, supporting
small businesses measures, and the retail, hospitality and leisure (RHL) expansion measure.

Economic and fiscal outlook

136

6

Fiscal aggregates

6.1

This chapter details how changes in our pre-measures forecast and Autumn Budget 2025
policy measures affect key summary measures of the public finances1, including:
•

Deficit aggregates including public sector net borrowing (PSNB), the difference
between expenditure and receipts; the current deficit, the difference between current
(day-to-day) expenditure and receipts; the primary deficit, the difference between noninterest expenditure and receipts; and cyclically adjusted measures of the deficit which
take account of the position of the economy relative to its potential level of output; and

•

Balance sheet aggregates including public sector net debt (PSND), which includes all
debt obligations net of liquid financial assets; public sector net financial liabilities
(PSNFL) which includes all financial liabilities and financial assets; and public sector
net worth (PSNW) which includes all financial and non-financial assets and liabilities.

Borrowing
6.2

Public sector net borrowing increased sharply to 10.2 per cent of GDP in 2009-10 following
the financial crisis, before falling in each year to reach 2.6 per cent of GDP in 2019-20
(Chart 6.1). It then increased again to a record high of 14.7 per cent of GDP in 2020-21
due to the pandemic and the policy response to it, reflecting both the large rise in cash
borrowing and the fall in nominal GDP in that year. After the pandemic, borrowing fell to
5.0 per cent of GDP in 2021-22 and has remained close to that level since then. Chapter 7
explores the reasons why borrowing has remained high in the four years since the
pandemic.

6.3

In our central forecast, borrowing falls to 4.5 per cent of GDP (£138 billion) in 2025-26
and then falls by around ½ a per cent of GDP a year thereafter to reach 1.9 per cent of
GDP (£67 billion) by 2030-31 (Chart 6.2). Around two-thirds of the projected 2.7 per cent
of GDP reduction in borrowing over the next five years comes from a 1.7 per cent of GDP
forecast increase in receipts. Higher income tax revenues, reflecting the frozen personal tax
thresholds, account for over half of this rise, with a further 0.5 per cent of GDP from capital
taxes. The remaining one-third of the reduction in borrowing as a share of GDP is due to
the forecast fall in spending of 1.0 per cent of GDP. Of this, 0.5 per cent of GDP is due to a
decline in departmental resource spending as a share of GDP in the final years. The rest
primarily reflects time-limited spending items, such as the Infected Blood Compensation
Scheme and Post Office redress scheme, which boost other AME spending in the near term,
and a rising surplus in unfunded public sector pension schemes.

Throughout this chapter and this Economic and fiscal outlook, unless otherwise stated, March 2025 forecast numbers as a per cent of
GDP have been rebased to remove the impact of 2025 Blue Book levels revisions.

Changes in borrowing since March
6.4

Borrowing in 2024-25 is £12 billion higher than estimated at the time of the March
forecast. This partly reflects higher local authority borrowing in outturn data, which is
discussed in Chapter 5, with further increases due to revisions to outturn data on central
government spending and receipts. Borrowing is now forecast to be £21 billion higher in
2025-26 than expected in March. The forecast for pre-measures public sector receipts in
2025-26 is broadly unchanged from March, meaning the increase is due to higher
spending particularly from upward revisions to the underlying forecasts for welfare, local

authority, and debt interest spending. Policy decisions, including the reversals to previously
announced welfare reforms, contribute £3.8 billion of the increase in borrowing in 202526, compared to March.
6.5

Over the rest of the forecast, borrowing is higher than expected in March by an average of
£16 billion in each year until 2028-29, and then lower than expected by £6 billion in 202930. These revisions are driven by the following factors:
•

Before taking account of the impact of Budget policy measures, spending on a premeasures basis is significantly higher than in March in every year and is £20 billion
higher in 2029-30. The main drivers of the increase in 2029-30 are local authority
spending, which on a pre-measures basis is forecast to be £6 billion higher than
expected in March due mainly to the costs of special educational needs provision
(SEND), and welfare spending, which is £8 billion higher mainly due to higher forecast
disability caseloads and inflation.

•

The pre-measures receipts forecast is higher than in March in every year, with the
difference rising to £14 billion in 2029-30. The main drivers of the increase are
income tax and NICs receipts which are forecast to be £10 billion a year higher, on
average, mainly due to higher forecast nominal earnings growth, and VAT receipts
which are £2.5 billion a year higher on average due to stronger forecast nominal
consumption.

•

The direct effect of policy measures increase borrowing by rising amounts over the next
two years, reaching £10 billion in 2027-28, but then reduce it from 2028-29 onwards,
by £15 billion in 2029-30 and £18 billion in 2030-31. Policy measures increase
spending in every year by amounts rising from £7 billion in 2026-27 to £11 billion in
2029-30, with the largest measures being the summer reversal of previously
announced welfare reforms and the removal of the two-child limit on benefits. Policy
measures increase receipts in every year of the forecast but particularly in the later
years, reducing borrowing by £26 billion by 2029-30 and £30 billion by 2030-31,
with the largest contribution from the freezing of personal tax thresholds and other
personal tax increases.

•

The indirect effect of policy measures decreases borrowing by £2.0 billion in 2026-27,
due to lower RPI inflation driving a £2.7 billion reduction in debt interest spending. In
the final four years of the forecast, the indirect effect of policy increases borrowing by
amounts rising to £4.1 billion in 2029-30, reflecting slower growth in receipts due to
lower nominal GDP.

•

SEND-related spending judgements reduce borrowing by £2.3 billion in 2028-29 and
£2.2 billion in 2029-30, due to spending on SEND being absorbed into existing
resource departmental spending limits from 2028-29 onwards. This reduces pressure
on local authorities, which are assumed to borrow less as a result in the following
years. This is explained in more detail in Box 5.1.

Current budget and other deficit aggregates
Current budget
6.6

The Government’s fiscal mandate is to balance the current budget by 2029-30. The current
budget is the difference between total current spending (i.e. day-to-day spending excluding
capital investment) and total current revenue. It is a similar measure to PSNB in that it
includes all public sector current receipts plus current spending, however it excludes
depreciation and capital spending.

6.7

The current deficit in the central forecast falls from £52 billion (1.7 per cent of GDP) this
year to reach a surplus in 2028-29, which grows to £22 billion (0.6 per cent of GDP) in
2029-30 and £25 billion (0.7 per cent of GDP) by 2030-31. Chapter 7 assesses the
Government’s performance against the fiscal mandate in more detail.

Compared to March, the current budget deficit is expected to be higher between 2025-26
and 2028-29 by an average of £11 billion a year. The current deficit is then expected to be
£12 billion lower in 2029-30, the target year for the Government’s fiscal mandate. This
reflects:
•

Pre-measures changes in receipts and spending which push up the current budget
deficit in each year, by £15 billion in 2025-26 and by £6 billion by 2029-30. These
revisions follow a similar path to the pre-measures changes in PSNB, largely driven by
higher welfare and local authority spending which are increasingly offset by higher
receipts, as set out in paragraph 6.5.

•

The direct effect of policy measures, which increases the current budget deficit over the
next three years but reduces it thereafter, by amounts rising to £22 billion by 2029-30.
It also follows a similar path to that for PSNB (as set out in paragraph 6.5) with
increases to spending, particularly on welfare, outweighed from 2028-29 onwards by
tax rises.

•

The indirect effect of policy measures decreases the current budget deficit by £2.3
billion in 2026-27, but increases it in each year thereafter by amounts rising to £4.7
billion in 2029-30. This reflects lower debt interest spending in 2026-27, due to lower
RPI inflation, and slower growth in the nominal economy in subsequent years, which
reduces receipts.

Other deficit measures
6.9

Other deficit measures also provide relevant information on the state of the public finances.
The primary deficit, which excludes net interest spending, is a useful proxy of the extent to
which discretionary spending is covered by revenues and is sometimes referred to as a
measure of ‘fiscal effort’. All measures of the deficit can be presented in cyclically adjusted
terms, correcting for an estimate of the position in the economic cycle, which provides a
rough indication of the underlying or structural deficit:
•

The primary deficit moves from 1.5 per cent of GDP this year before reaching a
surplus of 1.4 per cent of GDP by the final year of the forecast. If achieved, this would
be the largest primary surplus since 2000-01.

•

Cyclically adjusted measures of the deficit are slightly lower than the unadjusted
metrics for the first three years of the forecast, where they then move to equilibrium
thereafter. This reflects the negative output gap this year and subsequent closing of the
output gap across the forecast as monetary policy loosens.

Financial transactions
6.10

Changes in public sector net debt and wider balance sheet aggregates, including public
sector net financial liabilities, are calculated by combining changes in borrowing described
above with changes in financial transactions and valuation effects. Financial transactions
capture the effects of public sector net lending, sales or purchases of financial assets, and
interventions which affect the Bank of England’s balance sheet. They also convert the
accrued measures of tax and spending which underpin our forecast for borrowing into the
143

Economic and fiscal outlook

Fiscal aggregates

cash flows relevant to debt. Valuation effects capture changes in the value of the assets or
liabilities held by the public sector which count toward the measure of net debt.
6.11

6.12

In nominal terms, public sector net debt is forecast to increase in each year of the forecast
by an average of £121 billion a year. The top panel of Table 6.2 breaks down the
contribution to the year-on-year increases in PSND from public sector net borrowing, premeasures financial transactions, policy measures on financial transactions, and valuation
effects. It shows:
•

Public sector net borrowing is forecast to increase PSND in each year, by on average
£87 billion, for the reasons set out in paragraph 6.11.

•

Pre-measures financial transactions are forecast to increase debt in each year of the
forecast by an average of £30 billion across the forecast horizon, due to:
•

Repayments to the Bank of England’s Term Funding Scheme (TFS) which
reduce debt by £48 billion in 2025-26 and £28 billion in 2026-27. The TFS
then has no further effect until 2030-31 when it reduces debt by £16 billion
due to expected final payments as the scheme comes to an end.2

•

The cost of student loans, which increases debt by increasing amounts in
later years of the forecast, by an average of £10 billion a year, reflecting the
increase in tuition fees and rising entrant numbers.

•

Losses on gilts held within the Asset Purchase Facility being sold at less than
their face value, which add an average of £4.7 billion a year to debt.

•

Cash flow timing effects, which convert the accrued measures of tax and
spending in the forecast for borrowing into the cash flows relevant to debt,
raise debt by an average of £17 billion a year.

•

The direct effects of policy measures on financial transactions are relatively small over
the forecast period. In 2025-26, policy reduces debt by £1.7 billion due to changes to
the British Coal Staff pension arrangements. From 2028-29 onwards, increases in
departmental lending envelopes announced at the 2025 Spending Review add an
average of £1.9 billion a year.

•

Valuation effects increase debt each year by an average of £1.3 billion. This largely
reflects the consequences of new gilts being issued at a discount to the face value they
are held at in the public finances.

Table 6.2 shows that, relative to March, the year-on-year change in debt is forecast to be
higher in each year, by an average of £8 billion a year, until 2029-30 where it is forecast to
be lower by £7 billion. This is largely driven by the profile of higher borrowing across the

forecast until 2029-30, as set out in paragraph 6.5. The main changes due to financial
transactions compared to March reflect changes to the profile of TFS repayments which are
higher than expected in 2025-26 and lower in 2026-27. Asset Purchase Facility (APF) sales
losses are slightly lower than expected in March for the reasons set out in paragraph 6.14.

Asset Purchase Facility
6.13

The impact of the Bank of England’s Asset Purchase Facility (APF) on fiscal aggregates over
the forecast period is dependent on changes in Bank Rate expectations, gilt yields, and the
assumed pace at which gilts held within the APF are unwound.

6.14

Having reduced its gilt holdings by £100 billion in 2024-25, we assume a reduction in the
size of the APF of £70 billion between October 2025 and September 2026, reflecting the
145

Economic and fiscal outlook

Fiscal aggregates

Monetary Policy Committee’s (MPC’s) stated intention at its September 2025 meeting (Table
6.3). We then assume there will be a constant pace of active sales of £32 billion a year
which results in a total average reduction, including redemptions, of £65 billion a year over
the forecast period. The MPC does not set out a plan beyond the current year, so this
projection is based on the average active sales that occurred between 2022-23 until 202526.3 This reflects the MPC’s guidance that active sales will be conducted in a “gradual and
predictable manner”.4 The total annual assumed reduction in gilts held in the APF is on
average £16 billion lower than assumed in our March forecast.
6.15

We also consider the Bank of England’s survey of market participants on the pace of APF
unwind. On average, in the September survey, market participants expected the pace of
total unwind to fall to £65 billion in 2025-26 and to £40 billion in 2028-29.5 This implies
that active sales would be very low in 2028-29, at only £4.2 billion, despite the MPC policy
guidance that active sales will be conducted in a gradual and predictable manner. Further,
the market survey does not cover the full time horizon of our forecast. Therefore, we
continue to use the assumption set out above and we will keep this under review.

6.16

The APF’s direct impact on the current budget deficit, the Government’s target measure for
its fiscal mandate, is driven only by APF interest losses. APF valuation losses on sales or
redemptions do not affect the current budget but increase cash transfers from central
government to the Bank. Both interest and valuation losses on sales impact PSND and
PSNFL (Table 6.4).

6.17

APF interest losses are forecast to increase the current budget deficit in 2029-30 by £4.6
billion. Compared to the March forecast, higher Bank Rate expectations and the slower
pace of the unwind of gilt holdings act to increase APF interest losses and worsen the
current budget deficit by £1.3 billion in 2029-30. APF transactions increase PSNFL and
PSND by around £10 billion on average a year over the forecast period. Compared to
March, the slower assumed pace of APF unwind results in lower losses on sales which

The ‘Change in APF cash’ line captures transfers related to the cash buffer which is used to smooth cash flows between the APF and
the Treasury. Since the March forecast, there has been an update to the planned timing and nature of the cash inflows and outflows
from the buffer. This change impacts the profile of cash transfers but has a minimal impact to the lifetime cost of the APF.
Source: OBR

6.18

The latest estimate of the cumulative net lifetime loss from the APF is £164 billion by the end
of 2036, £30 billion higher than forecast in March 2025. This is mainly due to the slower
pace of sales combined with higher expectations for Bank Rate and gilt yields. The lifetime
estimate is highly sensitive to changes in interest rates. In a scenario where interest rates are
1 percentage point higher from next year, the lifetime cost is £39 billion higher.
Alternatively, a low interest rate scenario (1 percentage point lower) reduces the lifetime cost
by £40 billion (Chart 6.6).

6.19

This is not a comprehensive assessment of the overall fiscal impact of the Quantitative
Easing (QE) programme, which supported the economy, government financing costs, asset
prices, and financial markets at various points of stress over the past 16 years. These wider
economic and fiscal benefits would need to be considered in any comprehensive
assessment of the impact of QE. The Bank of England has estimated that reduced debt

6

A full estimation of the APF’s impact on the public finances requires consideration of central government financing. A slower unwind
pace would lead to smaller valuations losses, which lowers the financing requirement that is largely met through gilt sales, decreasing
debt interest payments.
7
Compared to our forecast, the total reduction in the APF would be £62 billion lower by 2028-29 if we had used the average from the
Bank of England’s September 2025 Market Participants Survey. This would worsen the current budget deficit by £0.5 billion and leave
PSNFL £8 billion lower in 2028-29, which is the final year in the market participants survey.

Financing requirement
6.20

Public sector net borrowing is comprised of central government, local government, and
public corporations borrowing. The central government net cash requirement (CGNCR),
which only covers central government borrowing and is on a cash basis, forms the basis of
the Debt Management Office’s (DMO’s) financing remit and so is the primary driver of the
net issuance of gilts.

6.21

Table 6.5 shows the relationship between the CGNCR and PSNB. First, financial
transactions are added to borrowing to get the cash requirement of the whole public sector
(PSNCR). The cash requirements for non-central government (local authorities, public
corporations and Network Rail) are then removed to get to the CGNCR excluding Network
Rail, which is the measure that feeds directly into the Government’s gilt issuance plans which
also cover the rolling over of maturing debt securities.

6.22

The CGNCR is forecast to be £150 billion this year. It is then expected to fall to £134 billion
in 2026-27 and then to remain broadly flat until declining in 2029-30 to £97 billion. The
CGNCR is on average £39 billion higher than PSNB across the forecast period, reflecting
the additional financing required for the financial transactions set out in paragraph 6.11.

8

The Bank of England’s Asset Purchase Facility Quarter 3 2025 report sets out the Bank’s projections for APF lifetime cash flows for a
number of scenarios. The report notes that the difference in the pace of unwind across various scenarios have a minimal impact on the
respective cumulative lifetime net present value.

Chart 6.7 shows the contributions to changes in PSCNR relative to the March forecast.
Public corporations account for the majority of the changes in PSCNR this year and next
year. This is due to the reprofiling of Bank of England’s TFS repayments, explained in
paragraph 6.11. Over the rest of the forecast period, the local government net cash
requirement increases PSCNR by an average of £5 billion a year. The CGNCR increases the
PSCNR in the first four years of the forecast but then reduces it in 2029-30, mainly due to
the impact of Budget policy measures reducing borrowing in this year.

As shown in Chart 6.8, gross gilt issuance by the DMO averages 8.5 per cent of GDP
across the forecast period (blue bars). Net gilt issuance is lower at an average of 3.4 per
cent of GDP, due to the redemptions of gilts (green bars) which average 5.0 per cent of
GDP. As the APF unwinds and sells off its gilt holdings (yellow bars), this adds to the total
gilt holdings by the private sector (orange line), which increase by an average 5.2 per cent
of GDP each year of the forecast period. This is around twice the amount of the average
increase in private sector holdings between 2000-01 and 2022-23. Box 6.1 highlights the

Box 6.1: The changing maturity of gilt issuance
Public sector net debt has risen from 28 per cent of GDP in 2000-01 to 94 per cent of GDP at
the end of 2024-25. The UK government meets most of its financing needs through the issuance
of gilts across varying maturities, and so the stock of outstanding gilts has risen over the same
period from 24 per cent of GDP to 83 per cent of GDP. With a high stock of debt, there are
significant volumes of redemptions each year as existing gilts mature and require refinancing at
the prevailing market interest rate.
The composition of gilts issued by the Debt Management Office (DMO) in recent years has
become more skewed toward shorter maturities. Ultra-short and short maturity buckets (gilts with
a maturity of less than seven years) are planned to make up 44 per cent of new issuance this
financial year, nearly a 20 percentage point increase compared to 2015-16. Issuance of long
maturity bonds (gilts with a maturity of 15 years or longer) has decreased by 20 percentage
points over the same period. As a result, so far this year, gilt issuance has an average maturity of
10 years, which is around half the average maturity of 20 years of the gilts issued a decade ago
in 2015-16. This shift in the Government’s issuance strategy to favour shorter-dated gilts reflects
shifts in market demand toward shorter maturities as defined benefit pension schemes reduce
their demand for longer-dated gilts, which we analysed in detail in the 2025 Fiscal risks and
sustainability report.

Economic and fiscal outlook

Fiscal aggregates

Despite this, the average maturity of outstanding UK marketable debt, at 14 years, continues to
be the highest in the G7 where average debt maturities average seven years and range from six
years in United States to nine years in Japan among other G7 countries, even after adjusting for
the impacts of Quantitative Easing (which reduce the UK average to around 11 years). And, as
the Bank unwinds its remaining holdings of longer-dated gilts, the average maturity of the debt
stock will lengthen.a
This increase in DMO gilt issuance at shorter maturities has had several implications:
•

In the short term, it reduces debt interest spending as gilt yields are currently lower at the
shorter end of the yield curve. Relative to the time of the March 2025 forecast, five-year
gilt yields have decreased by 7 basis points compared to an increase of 33 basis points
for 30-year gilt yields. If the DMO’s planned split of gilt maturities had remained the
same as Autumn 2015, and at unchanged gilt yields, debt interest costs would have been
approximately £2.4 billion higher by 2029-30. Whether movements in yields in the face
of a different issuance strategy would have offset this is unclear.

•

Over the medium term, it increases re-financing risk as more debt needs refinancing
each year exposing the government to short-term fluctuations in prevailing market rates.
A 1 percentage point shock to interest rates from 2025-26 would lead to a £17 billion
increase in debt interest spending in 2030-31. The current stock of conventional gilts this
financial year has an effective interest rate of 2.9 per cent. Based on current yields, which
are reflected in our central forecast, these redemptions would be re-financed at an
average expected yield of 4.4 per cent.

A shorter average maturity of debt, and the consequent increase in short- and medium-term
refinancing volumes, increases the risk that further fiscal adjustment may be required to maintain
debt sustainability, were interest rates to rise by more than expected in future. A rise in interest
rates compared to expectations will increase both the cost of new borrowing for the Government
and the cost of refinancing existing debt. Market pricing suggests that the weighted average gilt
rate in 2030-31 will be 1 percentage point higher than in 2025-26, so debt redeeming at that
point would need to be refinanced at a higher interest rate.
With higher overall debt interest costs, a government needs to run a higher primary balance (the
difference between revenue and non-interest expenditure) in order to stabilise debt. Over the
past decade, growth rates of nominal GDP have mostly exceeded effective interest rates which
meant a sustained primary deficit (a negative primary balance) could still lead to a stable debt
position. However, this is forecast to change mainly due to the sharp rise in interest rates from
2022 increasing the effective interest rate that the government pays on its debt. In our latest
forecast, a primary balance surplus is necessary from 2028-29 onwards in order to stabilise the
debt-to-GDP ratio.

Debt and other balance sheet aggregates
Public sector net debt
6.25

Public sector net debt (PSND) is forecast to rise steadily from 95.0 per cent of GDP in 202526 to 97.0 per cent of GDP in 2028-29. It is then forecast to fall to 96.1 per cent of GDP in
the final year of the forecast primarily due to a one-off set of loan repayments to the Bank
of England expected in that year (Chart 6.9). The drivers of the increase in PSND across the
forecast are explained in more detail in paragraph 6.11. Compared to the restated March
forecast, net debt is 1.1 percentage points higher this year and on average 1.5 percentage
points higher in every year through the forecast. This predominantly reflects higher
borrowing and higher valuation effects.

Public sector net debt (excluding the Bank of England)
6.26

Public sector net debt excluding the Bank of England (PSND ex BoE) is forecast to rise from
91.3 per cent of GDP in 2025-26 to 95.3 per cent of GDP in 2030-31. Compared to our
restated March forecast, PSND ex BoE is higher by 0.5 per cent of GDP this year and by 1.6
per cent of GDP in 2029-30. This largely reflects the same drivers of the change in net debt
except that it does not include TFS payments and APF sales losses. The difference between
PSND and PSND ex BoE as a share of GDP narrows from 3.7 percentage points this year to
just 0.7 percentage points in 2030-31 due to the winding down of the TFS and APF.

Public sector net financial liabilities
6.27

Public sector net financial liabilities (PSNFL) is one of the Government’s fiscal targets. It
includes non-debt liabilities such as funded pensions, monetary gold and special drawing
right (SDR) and additional illiquid assets such as loans (most notably student loans) and
equity holdings (largely the assets of funded pension schemes). The additional net assets
recorded in PSNFL mean that it is £370 billion (8.2 per cent of GDP) lower than PSND in
2025-26, with this gap growing to £513 billion (7.1 per cent of GDP) in 2030-31 (Table
6.6). This reflects the increase in the size of the public sector loan book, with increases in
pension liabilities and equity assets (the majority of which are assets held by funded pension
schemes) broadly offsetting each other.

In nominal terms, from a stock of £2.4 trillion in 2024-25, PSNFL is forecast to increase by
£131 billion in 2025-26 and then by decreasing amounts in subsequent years. The yearon-year changes in PSNFL largely reflect the profile in PSNB as well as:
•

Valuation changes in funded pension schemes, which reduce PSNFL by £8 billion in
2025-26 and £1.8 billion in 2026-27, but increase it thereafter. This reflects slowing
growth in equity prices over our forecast, which means that from 2027-28 onwards
pension liabilities grow faster than the schemes’ assets, which are largely concentrated
in equity.

•

Asset Purchase Facility (APF) sales losses, incurred when gilts are sold for less than
their redemption value, add to PSNFL by amounts rising year-on-year to reach £6
billion in 2030-31.

•

The premia on central government gilts push PSNFL up by £8 billion in 2025-26 but
by an average of £1.3 billion thereafter, as gilt prices rise and new debt is issued
nearer to par (face value).

•

Other valuation changes, which reduce PSNFL by £10 billion in 2025-26, largely as a
result of the appreciation of the UK’s stock of foreign reserve assets. In subsequent
years the reductions reflect the appreciation of equity assets not held in funded pension
schemes.

PSNFL is forecast to rise from 83.1 per cent of GDP in 2025-26 to a peak of 83.7 per cent
of GDP in 2028-29, before falling to 82.2 per cent of GDP in 2030-31. Relative to our
March restated forecast, PSNFL is higher in each year from 2025-26, by an average of 1.3
per cent of GDP a year. Higher nominal GDP, which reduces PSNFL by an average of 0.2
per cent of GDP, is more than offset by higher cash additions to PSNFL, which raise it by an
average of 1.4 per cent of GDP. These revisions to the stock of PSNFL reflect:

Economic and fiscal outlook

154

Fiscal aggregates

•

The upward revision to PSNFL outturn for 2024-25, which raises liabilities in each year
of the forecast by £35 billion.

•

Upwards revisions to pre-measures PSNB across each year of the forecast, which add
a total of £49 billion to PSNFL by the end of the forecast.

•

Policy measures, which raise PSNB in each year until 2028-29, adding a cumulative
£22 billion to PSNFL, but then reduce it in 2029-30 so add a total of £12 billion to
PSNB in 2029-30.

•

Valuation changes, which reduce PSNFL in each year by an average of £10 billion a
year and a total of £57 billion. This reflects stronger growth in equity prices, which
drives faster growth in equity assets across the forecast, in combination with lower APF
sales losses as a result of the slower assumed pace of unwind.

Our forecast for PSNFL also now incorporates more fully the activities of six public financial
institutions.9 These government-owned entities are tasked with managing financial
instruments and providing financial transactions, principally in the form of loans, equity
investments and guarantees. In aggregate, they reduce PSNB over our forecast and so also
reduce PSNFL, but push up on debt, as the financial assets they acquire in the form of loans
and equity are recorded within PSNFL but not PSND. The valuation of these assets within
PSNFL is a source of uncertainty.

6.31

Our forecast assumes that £1.2 billion of loans issued by these public financial institutions
are written off by 2030-31, which is around 3.0 per cent of the total loans extended over
this period. However, the risk of write-offs varies across different loan streams. Start-up
loans are extended by British Business Bank with the expectation that around 30 per cent of
new loans will eventually be written off. The ONS partitions these loans at inception, into a
loan asset (representing the proportion of the loan which is expected to be repaid) and a
capital grant (representing the proportion of the loan which is not expected to be repaid and
so pushes up PSNFL).

6.32

As the loan books of the institutions expand and we, alongside the ONS, learn more about
their activities, we will continue to reassess the risks around these valuations and the
implications for PSNFL. The Government is also developing its approach to managing these
risks and has published its latest Balance Sheet Framework alongside the Budget. This sets
out an updated framework for the financial management of public sector assets and
liabilities, including by public financial institutions, and for managing implicit liabilities
which may not currently be captured within measures of the balance sheet.

9

These are the British Business Bank, British International Investment, National Wealth Fund, UK Export Finance, as well as GB Energy
and the National Housing Bank which are due to be designated as public financial institutions once they are established, in line with the
Treasury’s Financial Transactions Control Framework.

Public sector net worth
6.33

Public sector net worth is the broadest measure of the Government’s balance sheet,
capturing the changes in the value of non-financial assets (NFAs) and liabilities associated
with unfunded pension scheme in addition to what is captured by PSNFL. Inverted PSNW
reaches a peak of 70.4 per cent of GDP in 2025-26, before falling by 2.4 per cent of GDP
at the forecast horizon. Compared to March, (inverted) PSNW is 1.6 per cent of GDP lower
in 2025-26, but higher by an average of 1.3 per cent of GDP a year thereafter.

6.34

All four measures of the balance sheet are projected to stabilise at the end of the forecast
period at historically high levels, but their trajectories differ (Chart 6.11). PSND ex BoE is
increasing across the forecast, while (inverted) PSNW declines in most years. PSNFL and
PSND both rise initially before falling in the final two years.

UK public finances in international context
6.35

Borrowing in the UK has followed a similar overall trend to both the G7 and advancedeconomy averages since 2005, but at a consistently higher level (Chart 6.12). 10,11 In the
wake of the financial crisis, there was a significant increase in borrowing across all
advanced economies and UK borrowing reached 10.1 per cent of GDP in 2009, higher
than both the advanced-economy and G7 average by around 4.2 per cent of GDP.
Following a period of consolidation, the pandemic led to another sharp rise in borrowing in
2020, which peaked in the UK at 13.2 per cent of GDP, higher than both the G7 average
and advanced-economy averages by 4.5 and 6.5 per cent of GDP respectively. UK

borrowing has remained around 5 per cent of GDP since the pandemic, persistently higher
than the G7 and advanced-economy averages. And while the policy measures set out in this
Budget are expected to help reduce UK borrowing to around 2 per cent of GDP by the end
of the decade, this would only reduce the UK’s deficit to the level that the average advanced
economy had already achieved several years ago.

As a result, the UK has experienced one of the largest increases in government debt of any
advanced economy over the past two decades. UK net debt on an internationally
comparable basis has nearly tripled as a share of GDP from 37 per cent in 2005 to 94 per
cent in 2024. The UK debt-to-GDP ratio has gone from being 1 percentage point higher
than the advanced economies average in 2005, to being 45 percentage points higher in
2024 (Chart 6.13). Compared with the G7 economy average, the UK debt-to-GDP ratio
has gone from being 10 percentage points lower than the average in 2005 to being 25
percentage points higher by 2024. Over the remainder of the decade, UK Government debt
levels are forecast to remain significantly above the averages of other G7 and advanced
economies.

Fiscal targets

Introduction
7.1

This chapter:
•

sets out the legislated fiscal targets and assesses their likelihood of being met on
current policy under our central forecast; and

•

considers uncertainty around our fiscal forecast and the risks to the Government
meeting its fiscal targets based on historical patterns of shocks to, and variations in key
macroeconomic and fiscal determinants.

The fiscal targets
7.2

The Chancellor has announced plans to change the legislative framework to reduce the
requirement on the OBR to assess the fiscal rules to once per year rather than twice, while
still requiring the OBR to produce two economic and fiscal forecasts per year. Once
enacted, this will affect some of the content of the Economic and fiscal outlook (EFO)
documents which accompany our spring forecasts from 2026 onwards, in particular in this
chapter, which we would change to meet the new legislative requirements. The OBR will
continue to produce and publish two full five-year economic and fiscal forecasts per year,
containing estimates for all the main economic and fiscal aggregates including those that
feature in the Government’s fiscal rules.

7.3

The current Charter for Budget Responsibility requires the OBR to judge whether the
Government has a greater than 50 per cent chance of meeting its fiscal targets under
current policy. The fiscal mandate in the Charter is:
•

7.4

to have the current budget in surplus in 2029-30, until 2029-30 becomes the third
year of the forecast. From that point, the current budget must then remain in balance
or in surplus from the third year of the rolling forecast period, where balance is
defined as a range: in surplus, or in a deficit of no more than 0.5 per cent of GDP.1 If
the range is used between fiscal events, the current budget must return to surplus from
the third year at the following fiscal event with a probability of at least 50 per cent.

There are also two supplementary targets in the Charter:
•

to have debt, defined as public sector net financial liabilities (PSNFL), falling as a share
of the economy in 2029-30, until 2029-30 becomes the third year of the forecast
period. Debt should then fall by the third year of the rolling forecast period; and

1

The Government states in the Charter that: ”this range will support the government’s commitment to a single fiscal event every year by
avoiding the need for policy adjustment at forecasts outside of fiscal events”.

161

Economic and fiscal outlook

Fiscal targets

•

7.5

to ensure that expenditure on welfare (excluding the state pension and payments
closely linked to the economic cycle) is contained within a predetermined cap and
margin.

The Charter further states that the Treasury will consider a wide range of indicators in its
management of fiscal policy.

Performance against the Government’s fiscal targets in the central forecast

7.7

Based on the latest forecast and as shown in Table 7.1, the centres of the distribution of
outcomes for the current balance and PSNFL-to-GDP ratio are such that:
•

The fiscal mandate, for the current budget to be in surplus in 2029-30, is forecast to
be met by a margin of 0.6 per cent of GDP (£22 billion), compared to a margin of 0.3
per cent of GDP (£10 billion) in March. The £22 billion margin by which the current
balance is in surplus in 2029-30 is around three-quarters of the average margin
(around £29 billion) that previous Chancellors have left themselves against meeting
their fiscal mandates.

•

The supplementary target, for public sector net financial liabilities to be falling as a per
cent of GDP in 2029-30, is forecast to be met by a margin of 0.7 per cent of GDP
(£24 billion), compared to a margin of 0.4 per cent of GDP (£15 billion) in March.

•

The welfare cap plus margin, set for 2029-30, is forecast to be met by £1.9 billion,
compared to a margin of £13.5 billion in March.

As shown in Table 7.1, all of these fiscal targets were also on course to be met in our premeasures forecast, but with a lower probability.

Fan charts

7.9

Fan charts, based on stochastic simulations and historic errors, allow us to assess the
probability of the Government’s fiscal targets for current budget and PSNFL falling being
met based on the distribution of historical shocks and forecast errors. Chart 7.1 shows the
probability distribution around the forecast for the current budget and PSNFL. It shows that
currently:
•

The probability of meeting the fiscal mandate to have the current budget in surplus in
2029-30 is now 59 per cent in the post-measures forecast, an increase from 52 per
cent in the pre-measures forecast and 54 per cent in the March forecast. The
improvement relative to the March forecast is due to both an increased margin but
also the fact that the target year is now the fourth year of the forecast, rather than the
fifth year. For this forecast, the probability distribution is such that there is a 60 per
cent chance that the current budget falls between a deficit of £62 billion and a surplus
of £111 billion in the target year 2029-30; and

•

The probability of meeting the supplementary target is now 52 per cent, increased
from 51 per cent in the pre-measures forecast and in the March forecast. There is a 60
per cent chance of public sector net financial liabilities lying between 75 per cent of
GDP and 94 per cent of GDP in 2029-30.

The width of the ranges within which there is a 60 per cent chance of the current balance
and net financial liabilities lying reflects the great uncertainty in forecasting the fiscal
position four years ahead based on unchanged policies, and the scale of shocks that can hit
the economy over such a period.

Change in the margins against fiscal targets
7.10

Based solely on underlying forecast changes to our pre-measures forecast, and before
taking into account the impact of policy announced at this Budget, both the current budget
and the PSNFL targets would have been met on the central forecast but with reduced
margins of £4 billion and £11 billion, respectively. Policy measures, discussed in detail in
Chapter 3, increase the current budget and PSNFL margins above the levels we forecast in
March and closer to the historical average margin that Chancellors have had since 2010.
As shown in Chart 7.2:
•

Underlying pre-measures forecast changes since the March forecast reduced the
margin by £6 billion for the current budget target and by £4 billion for the net
liabilities target. This was due to higher forecast local authority, debt interest, welfare,
and departmental spending, only partly offset by higher forecast tax receipts. This
leaves the current budget in surplus by £4 billion, and the PSNFL target in surplus by
£11 billion before the inclusion of Budget measures.

•

The direct effects of receipts policy announced at this Budget increase the current
budget margin by £26 billion and the PSNFL margin by £25 billion.

•

The direct effects of spending policy reduce the margins against the fiscal targets, by
£4 billion for the current budget and by £8 billion for the PSNFL target (which includes
capital spending measures that have no impact on the current budget).

•

The indirect effects of policy measures are forecast to reduce the margin by £5 billion
for the current budget target and £4 billion for the net financial liabilities target. Net
tax rises in this Budget reduce consumption and nominal earnings, thereby lowering
receipts. The higher cash borrowing due to the policy package also increases debt
interest spending.

•

This leaves the post-measures margin in the central forecast at £22 billion (0.6 per
cent of GDP) against the current budget target, £12 billion higher than in March. The
post-measures margin for the PSNFL target is now forecast to be £24 billion (0.7 per
cent of GDP), £9 billion higher than in March.

Margins against successive fiscal mandates
7.11

2

At this forecast, the margin against the Government’s fiscal mandate to balance the current
budget has more than doubled and is now around three-quarters of the average margin
that previous Chancellors have left against their fiscal mandate since 2010. Chart 7.3
shows that at 59 per cent, the probability of meeting the target is judged to be the highest
since before the pandemic. The £22 billion margin against the current balance target is
close to the average revision to our pre-measures forecast between fiscal events in the
fourth year of the forecast, at £21 billion.2 However, it is only around two-fifths of the
median four-year-ahead difference between forecast and outturn, which is £54 billion.

The figures relate to borrowing and are calculated using the revisions from our Forecast revisions database.

Welfare cap
7.12

The welfare cap is a limit for Government spending on certain social security benefits and
tax credits in the final year of a given Parliament. Since its introduction in 2014, the welfare
cap has been revised upwards frequently to account for inflation and changes in welfare
demand.

7.13

The Government set a welfare cap of £194.5 billion in 2029-30 at the October 2024
forecast, and a margin for the cap that rises each year to reach 5 per cent in 2029-30.
Spending within the welfare cap in 2029-30 has risen by £12 billion in this forecast, largely
due to the reversal of the welfare measures announced in March and increased disability
caseloads. This results in the welfare cap being on course to be met but only narrowly (by
£1.9 billion) once the margin is included.

Other fiscal indicators
Public sector net borrowing
7.14

Since the turn of the century, there have been two periods where public sector net borrowing
has increased significantly. The first was in the financial crisis where borrowing peaked at
10.2 per cent of GDP in 2009-10, after which it gradually fell to reach 2.0 per cent of GDP
in 2018-19. The second was the sharp increase during the pandemic to a post-war high of
14.7 per cent of GDP in 2020-21. This was followed by a more rapid decline in the
following year, but borrowing has since remained at the historically high level of around 5
per cent of GDP over the past four years.

7.15

This stubbornly high level of borrowing since the pandemic, has been the net result of
spending and tax increasing by equal amounts (0.6 per cent of GDP). In particular over the
years 2021-22 to 2024-25:
•

Spending has increased as a share of GDP, despite the ending of pandemic-related
support, due to a combination of higher welfare and higher debt interest spending. In
particular, debt interest spending increased by over 1 per cent of GDP, driven by
subsequent shocks including the European energy crisis and normalisation of global
interest rates. This has only been partially offset by lower departmental spending.

•

Receipts have increased as a share of GDP primarily reflecting the impact of frozen
personal tax thresholds and a rise in the rate of corporation tax from 19 to 25 per
cent, which more than offset reductions in employee National Insurance contributions.

167

Economic and fiscal outlook

Fiscal targets

7.16

In our November forecast, public sector net borrowing (PSNB) is projected to fall from 4.5
per cent of GDP this year to below 2 per cent of GDP in 2029-30. This fall below 2 per cent
of GDP would be five years later than we forecast in October 2021. Successive Budgets
have first pushed this point back, to 2027-28 in the March 2023 Budget, and then to
beyond the forecast horizon in the October 2024 Budget, and then brought it forward again
to 2029-30 in this Budget. This has been partly due to shocks such as the rapid rise in
interest rates and energy prices since 2021. But it is also due to fiscal policy choices.
Governments have repeatedly planned a consolidation of the public finances in the medium
term but a loosening of fiscal policy in the near term. This pattern is repeated in this Budget,
with policies adding on average 0.2 per cent of GDP to borrowing over this year and the
next three years but reducing it by 0.4 per cent of GDP on average over the final two years
of the forecast (Chart 7.4, left).

7.17

This pattern of borrowing has meant that the level of public sector net debt (PSND)
excluding the Bank of England continues to rise both in outturn and in our forecasts. It is
forecast to reach a level which would be 21 per cent of GDP higher than its 2007-2019
average in 2030-31, and 59 per cent of GDP higher than the average pre-2007 level. The
path of this measure of debt follows a similar pattern in this forecast to previous ones: with
debt initially forecast to rise and then stabilise in the later years at a higher level than in the
previous forecast. In the current forecast, debt is expected to reach 95.3 per cent of GDP in
2029-30, 1.3 per cent higher than forecast in March3 (Chart 7.4, right).

Balance sheet and fiscal affordability metrics

Alongside the formal assessment of the fiscal targets, we consider broader balance sheet,
debt affordability, and debt stabilisation metrics as indicators of fiscal sustainability. Table

with the medians from 1967-68 to 2006-07 (the four decades preceding the financial crisis)
and from 2007-08 to 2018-19; and second, whether they are improving or deteriorating in
each year of the forecast. It shows that the:

4
5

•

Balance sheet stock measures are all in a significantly worse position than both the
pre-2007 median and the 2007-2019 median, due to historically elevated borrowing
following the series of shocks to the economy over the last two decades. The bulk of
the increase occurred in the immediate years post-financial crisis before then surging
further following the onset of the pandemic. All measures are falling by the end of the
forecast, excluding PSND excluding Bank of England which is flat by the end of the
forecast. Inverted public sector net worth (PSNW) and PNSFL are also at a lower level
at the forecast horizon than outturn in 2025-26.

•

Cost of debt (flow) measures show a mixed position in comparison to the pre-crisis
median. Net interest costs as a share of GDP are slightly above the pre-2007 median
but then increase further through the forecast to 3.2 per cent of GDP in 2029-30.
While debt interest spending is at a historically high level, and is forecast to remain so
over the medium term, there has been a corresponding rise in interest and dividend
receipts in recent years. Net interest costs as a share of revenue remain below the pre2007 median through the forecast period, due to the record tax take as a share of
GDP, as outlined in Chapter 4.

•

The debt-stabilising primary balance is the level of the primary balance (non-interest
revenues minus non-interest spending) at which underlying debt remains constant as a
share of GDP. As the level of debt increases and the difference between the rate of
interest on government debt and the rate of growth in the economy widens, higher
primary surpluses are required to stabilise debt.4 The debt-stabilising primary balance
is currently a surplus of around £47 billion on average over the next five years.5 This is
much higher than the median debt-stabilising surplus of £8 billion between 20072019, largely due to rising real net interest costs in recent years. With the Government
running a primary deficit of £46 billion in 2025-26, the primary balance is currently
£100 billion away from its debt-stabilising level. The primary balance moves into a
surplus towards the end of the forecast, and increases to nearly match the debtstabilising primary balance in 2030-31.

A high level of stock-flow adjustments will also push up the debt stabilising primary balance.
In the chart below, debt stabilising primary balance is in relation to PSND ex Bank of England.

Recognising uncertainty
Specific risks
7.19

The OBR is required to assess whether the Government has a better-than-even chance of
meeting its fiscal targets, which we do by producing a median forecast relative to which the
outturn is equally likely to be higher or lower than predicted based on current policies. We
use several analytical tools to illustrate the risks around our central forecast including:
•

disclosure of specific risks to our economic and fiscal forecasts, focusing on those
which appear most material at the time;

•

fan charts, shown above in Chart 7.1, that reflect the chances of shocks of different
sizes (through stochastic simulations and forecast errors drawing on historical
experience) to illustrate the uncertainty around our assessment of the probability that
the fiscal targets are met;

Economic and fiscal outlook

170

Fiscal targets

7.20

7.21

•

sensitivity analysis that illustrates the vulnerability of the current budget and PSNFL
targets to changes in key forecast outcomes including gilt yields and nominal GDP
growth; and

•

scenarios that illustrate the vulnerability of the public finances to changes in
productivity and changes in equity prices.

Over recent years, large shocks and their aftermath have often resulted in significant
revisions to the economic and fiscal forecasts from one fiscal event to the next. We therefore
continue to emphasise the uncertainties around the forecast in the light of rapidly changing
economic conditions and the possibility that any of our key judgements could prove
significantly too optimistic or pessimistic. Specific sources of risks to our economy forecast
that we highlight in the sensitivity and scenario analysis in this EFO include:
•

The path for interest rates, both Bank rate and gilt yields, continues to be a source of
uncertainty with fluctuations contributing to sizeable revisions to debt interest spending
over recent forecasts. Sensitivity analysis set out below shows that a sustained 1
percentage point increase in Bank rate and gilt yields would increase the current
budget deficit by £16 billion in 2029-30, therefore sharply reducing the margin
against the fiscal mandate.

•

Productivity growth, as the key driver of economic growth over the medium and long
term, is central to the economic projections that underpin our fiscal forecast. As
outlined in Chapter 2, we have revised our forecast for productivity growth down by
0.3 percentage points relative to March, to 1.0 per cent at the forecast horizon, after
taking stock of its historical evolution and potential drivers over the forecast (see Box
2.1). As our productivity judgement continues to be a source of risk and one of the
most uncertain forecast variables for the public finances, we consider the potential
fiscal implications of higher and lower productivity growth described in Chapter 2
through scenario analysis in paragraph 7.25.

•

UK equity prices are, on average, 4 per cent higher than in our March forecast. The
price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio for US equities is close to the level seen during the dotcom
bubble and post-pandemic rally in 2021 (see Chart 2.3). While the P/E ratio of the
FTSE All-Share index of UK equities appears to be closer to historical trends, with the
FTSE All-Share index P/E ratio under its post-2010 average in October, global equity
markets are highly correlated. The IMF October 2025 World Economic Outlook
highlights the risk of a price correction to global equity prices, which poses a downside
risk to our UK fiscal forecast. We consider the potential fiscal implications of two equity
price shock scenarios in paragraph 7.30.

There are also several fiscal and policy-related risks to this forecast:
•

We highlighted risks around local authority (LA) finances in our March EFO and July
Fiscal risks and sustainability reports. Since March, estimates for LA borrowing over the
past three years has been revised up by a cumulative £11 billion. In part, this reflects
171

Economic and fiscal outlook

Fiscal targets

the financial pressures that have led an increasing number of LAs in England being
granted ‘exceptional financial support’ by central government. A particularly large
financial pressure is the provision of support for special educational needs and
disabilities (SEND). Currently, due to a ‘statutory override’, LAs can disregard the
deficits they have built-up financing this provision when meeting their requirement to
balance budgets each year. The statutory override is due to end in 2028-29 by when
these deficits could have reached a total of £14 billion, and a large number of LAs
would as a result not meet their balanced budget requirement. The Government has
not set out how this would be addressed and so it represents a significant fiscal risk.
•

There are several risks to departmental spending over the Spending Review period and
beyond. Inflation is now forecast to be higher than when Spending Review envelopes
were set in March 2025, reducing overall real spending growth by 0.1 per cent on a
pre-measures basis. The Government has stated that the full cost of SEND provision
will be absorbed within departmental budgets from 2028-29, but no savings have
been identified to offset the estimated £6 billion pressure this will create. Risks to
health spending include the impact on the NHS budget of any further strikes, and the
Government’s negotiations for the US trade deal on the cost of pharmaceutical
spending within the NHS. Major spending risks in other departments include: the
Spending Review assumption that the Home Office would fully stop the use of hotels
for asylum seekers by mid-2028 and deliver savings on the asylum budget of £1.1
billion; the risks around the implementation of digital ID cards for which no explicit
provision has been made for its £0.6 billion annual cost; and the Government’s
commitment for defence spending to reach 3.5 per cent of GDP by 2035, which we
estimate would cost around an additional £32 billion in today’s money.

•

There remains significant uncertainty around the future costs of welfare spending due
to the growth of disability and health caseloads, which have increased very sharply
since the pandemic. We assume in the forecast that these caseloads will continue to
rise but at a slower pace than recently. If growth instead continued at rates seen since
the pandemic this would increase spending in 2029-30 by around £11 billion. We
have also previously highlighted the risk that policy reforms are not implemented
which has crystallised at this event, with the Government no longer proceeding with the
changes to welfare set out in the Pathways to Work Green Paper in March.

•

The tax-to-GDP ratio is forecast to increase to a post-war high of 38.3 per cent of GDP
in 2030-31, largely due to policy changes announced at this Budget and over the past
few years. A higher level of the tax take increases the risk that incentives within the tax
system distort or constrain economic activity by more than expected. For example,
capital taxes are paid by a narrow base of typically higher-income taxpayers and are
often very sensitive to the behavioural responses to policy changes. The yield from the
personal tax threshold freezes, extended in this Budget, is very sensitive to future
inflation and nominal earnings growth. If nominal earnings growth was, on average
1.8 per cent lower than forecast, this would reduce tax revenues by 2029-30 by £19
billion. There are also risks that the tax gap, which is a measure of the degree of tax

Economic and fiscal outlook

compliance, does not fall by as much as forecast if compliance policy measures are
not as effective as expected.
7.22

At the same time, the Government has taken steps to address previously identified risks
pertaining to fiscal sustainability:
•

The target year against which the fiscal rules are assessed is now one year closer than
when the rules were set. As the target year moves closer to the near term, this requires
the Government to introduce necessary fiscal policy adjustments earlier in the forecast
period rather than backloading them into later years.

•

The introduction of the new mileage-based charge on electric cars means that the
Government is replacing some of the fuel duty receipts lost in the transition to a net
zero emissions economy. However, on the basis of the current policy settings, this only
makes up for about one-quarter of the receipts that will be lost from the decline of fuel
duty by 2050.

•

Alongside the Budget, the Government has set out an updated framework for balance
sheet management which aims to strengthen financial management and increase
transparency around public sector assets and liabilities. This should help to mitigate
some of the balance sheet risks set out in our July 2025 Fiscal fisks and sustainability
report. The Government has also released a framework for the management of
implicit liabilities that builds on recent reforms for the management of contingent
liabilities.

Sensitivities
7.23

Sensitivity analysis estimates how unit changes to key forecast variables would, in isolation,
affect the current balance using our fiscal ready reckoners. Chart 7.5 shows that:
•

A 0.1 percentage point reduction in nominal GDP growth in each year is estimated to
lead to a reduction in the current balance of £8 billion in 2029-30 and £10 billion in
2030-31.

•

A 1 percentage point reduction in the effective tax rate is expected to reduce the
current balance by £35 billion in 2029-30 and £36 billion in 2030-31.

•

A 1 percentage point increase in gilt yields on debt issued across the forecast and
Bank Rate expectations from 2025-26 is expected to reduce the current balance by
£16 billion in 2029-30 and £17 billion in 2030-31.

•

A 1 percentage point rise in RPI inflation across the forecast is expected to reduce the
current balance by £10 billion in 2029-30 and £12 billion in 2030-31.

Scenarios
7.24

In this EFO, we assess the economic and fiscal implications of alternative scenarios for
productivity and for equity prices. Box 2.1 outlines alternative scenarios for trend productivity
growth and the fiscal implications of these are explored below. From paragraph 7.30, we
explore the fiscal implications of a scenario in which equity prices fall sharply in 2026-27,
then remain permanently below our baseline forecast.

Productivity scenario
7.25

The outlook for productivity growth is one of the most important judgements in the forecast.
In this forecast, we have revised down our central estimate of underlying productivity growth
by 0.3 percentage points from 1.3 per cent to 1.0 per cent. Reflecting the significant
uncertainty around this judgement, we also set out lower and higher trend productivity
scenarios in Box 2.1, which have been derived from Briefing paper No.9: Forecasting
productivity published alongside this EFO. In the lower productivity scenario, trend

Economic and fiscal outlook

174

Fiscal targets

productivity growth remains at 0.5 per cent per year throughout the forecast. In the higher
productivity scenario, trend productivity growth averages 1.2 per cent and reaches 1.5 per
cent in 2030-31.
7.26

The fiscal implications of any revision to productivity will vary materially depending on how
it is reflected in the composition of nominal expenditure and incomes in the economy, which
are the main drivers of government revenues. As set out in Box 4.1, on a pre-measures
basis, despite the downgrade in productivity, receipts are expected to be higher than we
forecast in March. This is primarily because of increases to the forecasts for nominal
earnings growth, consumption and inflation. These mean that, despite the downgrade to
productivity, nominal GDP growth is only slightly lower than forecast in March and is
composed of stronger nominal labour income growth and slightly stronger nominal
consumption. These are fiscally beneficial as they drive the two largest sources of
government revenue – personal taxes and VAT. Revenues are given a further boost by the
fact that personal tax thresholds remain frozen in our pre-measures forecast until the end of
2027-28, which mean more taxpayers are dragged into higher tax brackets as a result of
these forecast changes.

7.27

In the scenarios presented here (see Chart 7.6), we assume that a change to productivity
drives an equivalent change in nominal GDP, which is then distributed uniformly across the
main expenditure and income components.6 There are no offsetting impacts elsewhere in
the forecast.

7.28

In the lower productivity scenario, in which annual productivity growth is on average 0.3
percentage points lower per year and 0.5 percentage points lower by the forecast horizon,
and the level of nominal GDP and nominal earnings are 2.0 per cent lower in 2030-31
compared to the central forecast. The fiscal implications of this are:
•

Receipts are lower by an average of £19 billion from 2026-27, rising to £25 billion in
2029-30, and £34 billion in the final year of the forecast, but remain broadly
unchanged as a share of GDP.

•

Spending is higher in nominal terms by an average of £1.6 billion from 2026-27 and
by £2.3 billion and £3.9 billion in 2029-30 and 2030-31 respectively. This is more
than explained by higher debt interest spending as a result of higher borrowing over
the forecast. In these scenarios, we assume the Government keeps nominal levels of
departmental spending unchanged in the face of the change in economic growth. As a
result, in this scenario departmental spending increases as a share of GDP. Overall,
spending as a share of GDP is 0.8 per cent higher than in the central forecast by
2029-30, largely due to the smaller size of the nominal economy.

•

The current budget remains in deficit across the forecast period. It falls from £56 billion
(1.9 per cent of GDP) this year to £6 billion (0.2 per cent of GDP) in 2029-30 but then
rises again to £14 billion (0.4 per cent of GDP) in the final year of the forecast.

6

The impacts presented in these scenarios will differ from those in Box 4.1 due to the calculations being derived by scaling the impacts of
the change in GDP on a tax-by-tax basis, whereas in these scenarios, we apply a single elasticity to all receipts.

175

Economic and fiscal outlook

Fiscal targets

•

7.29

PSNFL increases continuously over the forecast due to the compounding impact of the
increased borrowing in all years. It reaches 86.2 per cent of GDP in 2029-30 and
86.8 per cent in 2030-31, 4.6 percentage points higher than the central forecast by
the forecast horizon.

Conversely, the higher productivity scenario, in which productivity growth is on average 0.4
percentage points higher than our central forecast, results in the level of nominal GDP and
average earnings being 2.6 per cent higher in 2030-31. The fiscal implications of this are:
•

Receipts are higher by £24 billion on average a year from 2026-27 onwards, and by
amounts rising to £34 billion above our central forecast in 2029-30, and £44 billion
above our central forecast in 2030-31. However, they remain broadly unchanged as a
share of GDP.

•

Spending is lower by an average of £2.0 billion from 2026-27, and by £3.1 billion in
2029-30, and £5.0 billion in 2030-31. This is mainly driven by reduced debt interest
spending, as a result of lower borrowing. Given we assume the Government keeps
nominal levels of departmental spending unchanged, in this higher productivity
scenario departmental spending falls as a share of GDP. Overall, by 2029-30,
spending is 1.0 per cent of GDP lower than in the central forecast.

•

The current budget moves from a £51 billion (1.7 per cent of GDP) deficit in 2025-26
to a surplus of £59 billion (1.6 per cent of GDP) by 2029-30, rising further to £74
billion (2.0 per cent of GDP) in the final year of the forecast.

•

PSNFL falls at an increasing rate over the forecast period, from 82.9 per cent of GDP
in 2025-26, to 79.0 per cent of GDP in 2029-30 and 76.6 per cent of GDP in 203031, 5.6 per cent lower than in our central forecast by the forecast horizon.

Equity price scenario
7.30

Historically high valuations in global equities pose a downside risk to this forecast (as set out
in paragraph 2.9). To demonstrate the potential impacts of a shock to UK and world equity
prices on the economic and fiscal outlook, we have calibrated two scenarios using the
Oxford Economics Global Economic Model and our own judgements:
•

In the global correction scenario, a combined shock to UK and world equity prices
reduces both by 35 per cent at its peak in 2026-27 (implying around a 30 per cent fall
in the US S&P 500 P/E ratio). This reduces household wealth and firms’ net worth,
which, exacerbated by a sharp fall in confidence, widens the negative output gap.
Relative to our central forecast, this reduces UK real GDP by 0.6 per cent in 2027-28,
as households lower consumption and businesses cut or postpone investment. In the
medium term, confidence recovers and the output gap closes. But potential output in
2030-31 is 0.1 per cent lower than in our central forecast, while real GDP is also 0.1
per cent lower. Both world and UK equity prices are 10 per cent below the level
assumed in our central forecast at the horizon (see Chart 7.7).

•

In the limited UK contagion scenario, a shock to world equity prices leads to a 35 per
cent fall at its peak in 2026-27. There is no direct shock to UK equities, but reduced
global risk appetite and profits, and reduced domestic confidence, nonetheless lead to
a more muted fall in UK equity prices of 15 per cent in 2026-27. But as a small, highly
globally integrated economy, the effects on real GDP through lower household wealth
and business confidence are similar to the global correction scenario. Relative to our
central forecast, real GDP is 0.5 per cent lower in 2027-28, and 0.1 per cent lower in
the medium term. World equity prices remain 10 per cent below our central forecast at
the horizon, whereas UK equity prices are around 5 per cent lower.

7.32

In the global correction scenario, nominal GDP at its peak is 1.1 per cent below our central
forecast in 2027-28, but as equity prices recover and the output gap closes this difference
narrows to 0.4 per cent below our central forecast in 2030-31. The fiscal implications are
that:
•

Receipts are £27 billion lower than in our central forecast in 2027-28, before
narrowing to a £13 billion reduction in the mandate year, 2029-30. Capital gains tax
accounts for around half of the fall in receipts, with income tax and inheritance tax
also being significant contributors.

•

Spending is lower in 2026-27 and 2027-28 due to a fall in inflation, but is then up in
later years, rising to an increase of £2.8 billion in 2029-30 from higher debt interest
spending as a result of the increases to cash borrowing.

•

As a result, the current budget deficit widens by £26 billion (0.8 per cent of GDP)
relative to our central forecast in the peak year of impact, 2027-28, before it then
narrows to £16 billion (0.4 per cent of GDP) higher than our central forecast in 202930. The fiscal mandate is still met, but by a margin of just £6 billion.

In the limited UK contagion scenario, the impact on receipts is less sharp and the current
budget deficit widens by £15 billion initially and £9 billion in 2029-30, around 60 per cent
of the impact of the global correction scenario.

In the global correction scenario, the PSNFL impact peaks at 6.8 per cent of GDP higher in
2026-27, and 3.7 per cent of GDP higher in 2029-30, than in our central forecast. Despite
the significant upwards adjustment, the fiscal target for PSNFL to be falling in 2029-30 is on
track to be met by a margin of £41 billion, £17 billion higher than the margin in the central
forecast, because the peak impact from the shock on PSNFL occurs in years before 202930. In the limited UK contagion scenario, PSNFL is 2.1 per cent of GDP higher than in the

central forecast, around half the impact of the global correction scenario, and also still falls
in the target year 2029-30.
7.34

A significant proportion of the change to PSNFL in the early years of the equity price shock
comes from a reduction in the valuation of the equity assets held by funded pension
schemes. In the global correction scenario, these valuation effects account for almost all the
increase in PSNFL in 2026-27, representing £201 billion out of the £209 billion change,
but valuation effects account for less than half of the increase in 2029-30 as equity prices
have partially recovered by then. The rest of the increase is a result of the cumulative
increase in borrowing.

While the current balance and PSNFL remain significantly higher than our central forecast in
the mandate year, both fiscal rules are still met in both scenarios. This is partly an artifact of
the timing of the equity shock in 2026-27, which means that the economic and fiscal
impacts have partly abated by 2029-30. In the global correction scenario, were the shock to
happen later, in 2027-28 for example, then the current balance rule would likely not be on
course to be met in the target year.
